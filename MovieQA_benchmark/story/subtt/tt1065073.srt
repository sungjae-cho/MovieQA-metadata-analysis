1
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,561
Hey, love bug.
You ready?

2
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,683
Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,309
Hey, guess what, Mom?
What?

4
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,141
I figured out where
<i>wasps</i> come from.

5
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,817
Oh, yeah? Where?

6
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,065
Well, I think
it must be,

7
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,400
if you flick water into the air
just right, it'll turn into a wasp.

8
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,325
Hey!
Yep.

9
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,618
That's cool.

10
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,113
So, how was your day
at school?

11
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,948
Fine.

12
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,161
I had a good meeting with Miss Butler
this time. I kind of liked her.

13
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,120
What'd she say?

14
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,831
Well, she said that you weren't
turning in your homework assignments.

15
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,131
And I told her,
"I know he does them,

16
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,800
"'cause I check them
every night."

17
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,423
She said she found
a big chunk of them

18
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,800
crumpled up at the bottom
of your backpack.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,427
She didn't ask for 'em.

20
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,259
Baby, she doesn't have to. You're
just supposed to turn them in.

21
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,101
And she said you're still
staring out the window all day.

22
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,186
Not all day.

23
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,902
And she said that you destroyed
her pencil sharpener.

24
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,904
Not on purpose!

25
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,152
Wait! She said that you crammed
a bunch of rocks in it.

26
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,151
I thought if we could
sharpen pencils,

27
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,985
maybe we could
sharpen rocks.

28
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,623
Well, what were you gonna do
with a bunch of sharpened rocks?

29
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,044
I was trying to make arrowheads
for my rock collection.

30
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,209
Hmm.

31
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,484
Dude, my turn!

32
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,606
Hold on.

33
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,454
Mason!

34
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,536
Samantha!

35
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,204
Oh!

36
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,381
Tommy! ls Mason down there?

37
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,749
Yeah.

38
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,586
Well, tell him he has to
come home to dinner.

39
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,171
Okay.

40
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,435
<i>Hey-</i>

41
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,646
Hey, sweetie.
Why aren't you ready?

42
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,985
Hey, Mason.

43
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,111
Hey, Ted.

44
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,158
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go.

45
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,160
What time is it? It's 9:00.
Let's go, let's go!

46
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,364
Okay, I meant to call you,
'cause Janice flaked out.

47
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,824
I don't have a sitter.

48
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,249
Why didn't you
call somebody else?

49
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,747
I can't get a babysitter now.
It's 9:00.

50
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,704
But you're welcome to
hang out with us.

51
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,460
Well, no!
I mean, we have plans.

52
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,382
The guys are expecting me.

53
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,961
Well, you can go.
All right.

54
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,717
I'll come back in
a couple of hours.

55
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,389
Is that okay?

56
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,352
Yeah. Yes, it's okay.
All right.

57
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,855
"'Turn back! Turn back! I don't
wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle.'

58
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,357
"'Who?' said Harry,
<i>as</i> they backtracked quickly.

59
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,859
"'She haunts
one of the toilets

60
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,067
"in the girls' bathroom on the
first floor, ' said Hermione.

61
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,244
"'She haunts a toilet?'

62
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,866
'Yes, it's been
out of order all year,

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,040
"'because she keeps having
tantrums and flooding the place!'

64
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,195
"'l never went in there
anyway, if I could avoid it.'

65
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,041
"'It's awful trying to have a
pee with her wailing at you."'

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,650
Why can't you
just say that?

67
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,831
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,625
I don't wanna go with you.
You're sorry, that's bullshit!

69
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,005
That's right. I wanna
stay here with my kids.

70
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,131
That's what I'd rather do.

71
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,305
Would you stop using
your kids as an excuse?

72
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,474
I know you have to stay here
with your kids! You're acting...

73
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,473
You have this immature life.
You have no responsibility!

74
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,553
I have
an immature life!

75
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,889
I have responsibility.
I have an immature life.

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,972
You don't know what
it's like to be a parent.

77
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,056
No, I don't!

78
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,068
And why am I responsible
for your mistakes in life?

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,396
Don't call my kids mistakes!
Don't!

80
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,651
I didn't call your kids...

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,482
You said, "Your mistakes in your
life," pointing at my kids.

82
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,909
I know what I said, you know. And
immediately you use your kids again.

83
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,282
This is the reality.
I'm a parent!

84
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,080
- That means responsibility.
- I know you're a parent.

85
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,908
I would love to
have some time to myself!

86
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,834
I would love to just
go to a fuckin' movie!

87
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,082
You don't think
I'd like that?

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,289
Go have some dinner,
go to a bar!

89
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,732
I don't even know
what that's like!

90
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,794
I was someone's daughter, then I
was somebody’s fuckin' mother!

91
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,594
Okay? I don't know
what that's like!

92
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,768
Stop!

93
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,437
Quit it!

94
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,942
Quit it!

95
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,457
Mom!

96
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,334
What the hell is
going on in here?

97
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,998
Do you guys
know what time it is?

98
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,797
He's throwing
things at me.

99
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,964
Mason! Do not throw
things at your sister!

100
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,886
She's faking,
she hit me first!

101
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,555
Listen, both of you!

102
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,631
I'm going back to bed.

103
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,934
I don't wanna hear another
peep out of here for an hour.

104
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,010
Go to sleep.

105
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,516
- Faker!
- Guys!

106
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,664
Awesome!

107
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,334
Look what I found
in the street.

108
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,670
Dude!

109
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,669
I know, right?

110
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,672
Look at those.

111
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,003
Ooh! Look at those!

112
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,178
Awesome!

113
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,572
So listen, guys, I wanna
talk to you about something.

114
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,291
And you might not like
this idea at first,

115
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,946
but we're moving
to Houston.

116
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,365
When?

117
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,657
Well, soon.

118
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,746
We should be out
by the first,

119
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,585
so we don't have to pay
two rents next month.

120
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,042
No, Mother, we're not moving.
Nope, nope.

121
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,715
Sorry, Mom. Nope. Nope.

122
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,377
Samantha, I have to
go back to college,

123
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,740
so I can make us
a better living.

124
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,014
With this job, I can't take
care of us the way I'd like to.

125
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,434
I can't keep
going this way.

126
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,182
And Grandma said
she'd help us out,

127
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,103
and it would be nice
to be near her.

128
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,179
Fine, Mother.

129
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,519
You can do
whatever you want,

130
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,521
but we're not moving.

131
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,649
And what about
our friends?

132
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,028
Oh, baby, we can
email them or write.

133
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,734
We can come back to visit.

134
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,986
And guess what?

135
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,491
This place that
Grandma found us,

136
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,073
you'll each have
your own room. Right?

137
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,076
And there's a pool.

138
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,623
Morn, do you
still love Dad?

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,758
I still love your father,

140
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,551
but that doesn't mean it was
healthy for us to stay together.

141
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,099
What if after we move he's
trying to find us and he can't?

142
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,642
Oh, that won't be a problem.

143
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,980
He can call Grandma
and she'll tell him,

144
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,605
or he can call Information.

145
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,312
We won't be hard to find.

146
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,564
Is he still in Alaska?

147
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,195
Well, that's what your uncle says.

148
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,198
Probably taming
polar bears or something.

149
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,948
Yeah. Well, I hope they're taming him.

150
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,295
Here, wanna help me out?

151
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,470
Sure.

152
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,551
Okay. Take this paint
very carefully

153
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,887
and paint any little
smudge or mark or anything

154
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,313
on the baseboard there,

155
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,813
behind the door and all around
the doorways on the inside.

156
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,271
She <i>says</i>
we're gonna come visit

157
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,481
and I'm gonna write
and call you.

158
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,990
Oh, wait, hold on a second.
I'm getting another call.

159
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,079
Hello?

160
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,997
Sorry, Tommy.

161
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,576
Mason can't come over today.
We're moving.

162
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,001
And I'm on the other line.

163
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,124
Bye.

164
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,918
Althea?

165
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,676
I'm gonna be sending
Sailor Scout instructions.

166
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,173
Email and write back telling me
how the other scouts are doing.

167
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,846
Well, because
you're the leader now.

168
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,851
Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna
get there before it gets dark.

169
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,481
Goodbye, yard. Goodbye, crape myrtle.
Goodbye, mailbox.

170
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,062
Goodbye, box of stuff Mommy
won't let us take with us,

171
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,772
but we don't wanna
throw away.

172
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,856
Goodbye, house.

173
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,989
I'll never like Mommy <i>as
</i> much for making us move!

174
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,365
Samantha!

175
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,243
Why don't you say goodbye to that
little horseshit attitude, okay?

176
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,290
'Cause we're not taking
that in the car.

177
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,496
Goodbye, old lady who listens
to rock music and rides a motorcycle.

178
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,021
Hey!

179
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,192
What's happening back there?
Stop, put the barrier up.

180
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,324
Hey! Put the pillow
between you.

181
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,032
Make a barrier,
come on. Stop.

182
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,834
We're gonna play a game
called The Game of Silence.

183
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,085
Whoever can stay quiet for the
longest period of time wins.

184
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,332
You guys think
you can do that?

185
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,085
Okay, go.

186
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,864
The bus will be here
in 10 minutes.

187
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,329
Put that homework
in your backpack.

188
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,457
Go eat!

189
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,376
Baby, go eat.

190
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,711
I am!

191
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,856
Speak English!

192
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,904
Shut up! Mom!

193
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,856
She's speaking that
stupid language again!

194
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Samantha!

195
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,735
I was speaking perfectly
clear English, Mother.

196
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,741
He's a little slow
in the head.

197
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,413
He did officially
flunk first grade.

198
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,615
Sit your butt down!

199
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,291
Yes, sir, Mother, sir!

200
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,880
All right, listen up, guys. Grandma's
gonna pick you up after school.

201
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,298
Your dad's in town
for the day.

202
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,750
So you're gonna spend
the afternoon with him.

203
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,093
Oh.
Is he moving back?

204
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,712
I don't know.

205
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,093
We haven't seen him
in about 80 years.

206
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,099
Like a year and a half.

207
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,601
Ha-ha!

208
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,676
Oh, please.

209
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,562
Can we please eat here?
The bus is coming.

210
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,685
Who wants syrup?

211
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,899
All right,
nice cursive.

212
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,113
Okay, Mason, when I check the
mobiles, am I gonna find yours?

213
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,189
No.

214
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,320
And why not?

215
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,151
'Cause I didn't
finish it.

216
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,952
Well, it's time
to finish it.

217
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,370
Just a minute.

218
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,868
No, let's do...
Apple Quit.

219
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,467
Time to finish your work, Mason.
"Apple Quit."

220
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,060
- So this is my history test.
Mmm-hmm.

221
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,733
"A+", very good.

222
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,319
And that's
another history test.

223
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,112
Mmm-hmm.
And another "A".

224
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,239
Yeah, it doesn't have
a plus, but, oh, well.

225
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,943
And then, um, that's
my report on lizards.

226
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,404
Oh. Let me see
your pictures.

227
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,829
Oh, yeah.
These are my pictures.

228
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,076
What is that?

229
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,282
Well, that's called
a dewlap.

230
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,867
A dewlap, okay.

231
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,510
Oh, yeah,
this is a math test.

232
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,627
Oh, "A" again.

233
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,422
Mase, that's the last
candy, okay?

234
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,090
Okay.

235
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,822
We need to put this stuff up.

236
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,592
That's him.

237
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,102
Daddy!

238
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,264
Oh, my God! Look at
you, you're so big!

239
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,850
<i>Hey, MJ.</i>

240
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,184
What's happenin', buddy?

241
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,314
Huh? You guys ready
to have some fun?

242
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,393
Yeah!

243
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,154
Yeah! All right.

244
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,114
Hey, Catherine, how are you'?
Mase, I'm good.

245
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,237
Mmm, good to see you.
Yeah.

246
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,284
What time should
I have these rascals back?

247
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,033
Oh, I don't know,
around 7:30, I guess.

248
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,271
I gotta get them
home by 8:00.

249
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,370
Oh, you know what, why don't I
take 'em over to their mom's?

250
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,076
No, that's okay.
She's expecting me.

251
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,287
No, that's all right. You guys
know where it is, don't you?

252
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,963
Oh, yeah. All right. I'll do it.
It's no problem.

253
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,130
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

254
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,549
Look, it's no problem.
All right'?

255
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,501
You guys ready to go? Let's do it, go!

256
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,212
Go? Wait a minute.
You gotta get your stuff.

257
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,922
You got backpack,
your purse,

258
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,633
homework,
go to the bathroom.

259
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
Can't believe how big they are.

260
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,266
Yeah. Time's going by.

261
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,768
Must be nice for you,
having 'em here in Houston.

262
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,650
I love it, yeah. I'm
volunteering at their school.

263
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,606
Yeah? What you doing
over there?

264
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,904
I'm in the library. You know,
reading to the little ones.

265
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,907
Oh, great.

266
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,535
So, Alaska, huh?

267
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,700
Yeah.

268
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,246
Are you back?

269
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,580
We'll see.

270
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,873
How's Liv?

271
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,384
She's a busy girl.

272
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,050
She's back in school.

273
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,094
But she's working
and single parenting.

274
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,016
A lot to juggle.

275
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,775
- You guys got everything?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:28,936
All right, say goodbye
to your grandmother.

277
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,103
Bye, Grandma.

278
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,181
All right, let's roll.
Uh, no, wait a second.

279
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,061
You're not the type of kids
who like presents, are you?

280
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,737
Yes!
No, you don't.

281
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,902
Of course we do. Presents?
Really? Let's do it!

282
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,278
<i>Yay!</i>

283
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,029
I call front seat!

284
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,349
I wanted
the front seat, though.

285
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,075
All right. Well, Mason
gets it on the way there

286
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,781
and Samantha gets it
on the way back.

287
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,991
- Hop in there.
- Seat belts!

288
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,043
Seat belts.
All right. Seat belts.

289
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,620
Don't forget
your seat belts.

290
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,505
It's not like this car
has any seat belts.

291
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,208
Mmm...

292
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,638
Nice. Nice. Nice!

293
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,891
Come here, come here, yes!

294
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,015
Oh, that was awesome!

295
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,435
Get up there, Mason! Get up there!
It was so good!

296
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,766
Come on.

297
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,105
Let 'em know
who you are, buddy.

298
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,983
Let 'em know
who you are.

299
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,187
Mwah!

300
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,281
Yes! Yes! Yes!

301
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,238
All right. All right,
don't worry about it.

302
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,161
Wish we could
use the bumpers.

303
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,159
Bumpers are for kids!

304
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,165
What are you,
two years old?

305
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,791
You don't want the bumpers.

306
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,919
Life doesn't
give you bumpers.

307
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,722
There we, there we go. There we go!
We got something there!

308
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,639
We got something!
We got something!

309
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,932
Oh!

310
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,139
Last time I went bowling, we had
bumpers and it was a lot more fun!

311
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,974
You don't want the bumpers,
all right'?

312
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,434
You bowl a strike
with the bumpers

313
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,064
and it doesn't
mean anything.

314
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,190
Trust me.

315
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,107
Just lay it out
on the lane.

316
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,945
One, two, three and...

317
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,734
Let's hear it
for the father!

318
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,783
Boom!

319
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,956
- Get up there!
- Great shot!

320
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,288
Get out there, girl!

321
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,879
<i>Four Blackwater
operatives have been viciously attacked</i>

322
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,430
<i>in their cars in Fallujah.</i>

323
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,884
<i>The bodies and cars were set on
fire after insurgents started...</i>

324
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,685
Look at this!
It's a disaster.

325
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,767
Let me tell you what's
happening in Iraq, all right?

326
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,348
Exactly what every thinking
person in the world

327
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,525
knew was gonna happen
before they got started.

328
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,230
But Bush and his little numb-nut
fanatics he's got around him,

329
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,564
they don't give
a rat's ass.

330
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,781
That's a quarter.

331
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,149
What's a quarter?

332
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,610
You said A-S-S.

333
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,620
Oh, sorry. My bad.

334
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,874
And my teacher says
it's a good war,

335
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,872
because it's better
to be safe than sorry.

336
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,123
That's what they're
teaching you in school?

337
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,375
All right. Listen to me.
Listen to your father, okay?

338
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,877
That is the lie.
That's the big lie.

339
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,506
Iraq had nothing to do with what
happened at the World Trade Center.

340
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,586
You know that, right?

341
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,300
I guess.

342
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,381
Who you gonna vote
for next fall, MJ?

343
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,098
I don't know.

344
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,801
He can't vote.
He's not 18.

345
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,289
All right,
who would you vote for?

346
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,518
Kerry?

347
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,147
Anybody but Bush! Okay?

348
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,148
Are you gonna move back?

349
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,447
Uh, I'm planning on it.
You know, I gotta find a job.

350
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,359
Are you and Mom
gonna get back together?

351
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,784
I don't know.

352
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,909
That's not, uh, entirely
up to me, you know?

353
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,375
I remember
when I was six,

354
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,125
you and Mom
were fighting like mad.

355
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,457
You were yelling so loud
and she was crying.

356
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,755
That's what
you remember, huh?

357
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,835
Yep.

358
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,171
You don't remember
the trips to Galveston,

359
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,473
camping in Big Bend,
all the fun we had?

360
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,549
Nope.

361
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,264
You ever get mad
at your mother'?

362
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,391
Yeah.

363
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,055
You ever get mad at your brother?
Yeah.

364
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,224
Yeah. You ever yell at him?
Oh, yeah.

365
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,526
Doesn't mean you
don't love him, right?

366
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,978
Mmm...

367
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,780
Look, the same thing happens
when you're grown up, all right?

368
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,323
You know,
you get mad at people.

369
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,742
You know,
it's not a big deal.

370
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,736
What'd you do in Alaska?

371
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,369
I worked on a boat
for a while. Um...

372
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,334
I tried to write some music.

373
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,249
Did you see
any polar bears?

374
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,376
No.
But I saw a Kodiak bear.

375
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,798
It was fuckin' huge!

376
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,922
Dad! That's 50 cents
for the F-word!

377
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,596
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,892
Here, take a dollar, all right?
Keep the change.

379
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,179
You guys are gonna be seeing
a lot more of me. Okay?

380
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,686
I missed you two real bad while I was
gone, okay, I want you to know that.

381
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,065
I just needed to take some
time, you know, to...

382
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,437
Just...

383
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,232
Your mom and me, okay...

384
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,696
Well, your mother, okay,
is a piece of work, all right.

385
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,999
I think you know that
by now, all right?

386
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,663
And I'm just...

387
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,586
I'm so happy to be
with the two of you, okay?

388
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,879
And I'm sorry about
that bumper business.

389
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,458
I'm gonna get better
at stuff like that, okay?

390
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,840
I got that one
at Dripping Springs,

391
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,297
and, um, my friend Rodney
gave me that one.

392
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,882
- Yeah?
- And I bought that one.

393
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,387
You bought this one?
Yeah.

394
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,719
You found this at Dripping Springs?
Uh-huh.

395
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,019
Wow.

396
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,687
What else do you got?

397
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,857
Well, um,
these are snake vertebrae.

398
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,568
Snake vertebrae? That's disgusting.
Huh?

399
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,213
Mason, I don't want you collecting
snake vertebrae anymore.

400
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,360
Is this the feather
I sent you?

401
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,908
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it is.

402
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:38,238
Oh, Dad! Um, I forgot to show you,
um, these basketball pictures.

403
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,914
You're on a basketball team?
Yeah.

404
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,412
Wow! Check you out!

405
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,788
These are beaver claws.
Beaver claws?

406
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:44,869
That's me.

407
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,917
Yeah. No.
What, you hunting beaver'?

408
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,748
You see, that's McKinney,
that's Meg and that's Gem.

409
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,832
Those are my friends.
Uh-huh.

410
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,087
What position
do you play?

411
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,259
Um, guard.

412
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,586
This is dried Canadian grass.
Uh-huh.

413
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,949
Wait, have you
scored any points?

414
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,204
Well, about eight
or 10 a game.

415
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,383
Eight or 10 a game?
That is awesome!

416
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,685
Once, she didn't score any
and she cried!

417
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,761
You cried?

418
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,016
Well, only a little bit.
Aw...

419
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,773
Hello!
Pomegranate.

420
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,442
Oh, Mason, Mom's home!

421
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,643
Mom's home!

422
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,853
Mom's home.

423
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,320
Mom! Hi! Look at this owl
Daddy gave me!

424
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,527
Isn't it cool?
See, its head spins!

425
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,488
And look at this bracelet. It
was made by Indians in Alaska.

426
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,121
And Daddy made this cool hand-carved
grizzly bear and this tiki.

427
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,952
- It's a totem.
- And guess what else?

428
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,164
We went bowling and I made four strikes!

429
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,840
Yeah, and we got to ride
around in Dad's car! Wow.

430
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,793
Hey, Liv.
Hey.

431
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,423
I know you wanted me to drop
them off at your mom's.

432
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,221
I just thought it'd be easier
if I brought 'em over here.

433
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,886
Well, it really
screwed up my plans.

434
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,147
Well, we just wanted
to show him our rooms.

435
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,220
Yeah.

436
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,343
Did you guys eat anything?

437
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,311
Well, we had some French
fries at the bowling alley.

438
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,642
Did you do your homework?

439
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,817
No.
Not yet.

440
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,441
Okay. Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

441
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,656
Yeah. Sure.

442
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,653
They had more
than French fries.

443
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,384
Do you think he's gonna
spend the night?

444
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,099
Doesn't look like it.

445
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,543
<i>Okay.
An unconditioned stimulus,</i>

446
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,000
<i>something that produces
an unlearned,</i>

447
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,138
involuntary,
unconditioned response.

448
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,465
Now, in Pavlov's experiment,

449
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,926
what was the stimulus
that he used?

450
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,888
Come on now, people! Tough weekend?
What's the deal here?

451
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,724
Meat, right? Meat.
Meat powder, actually.

452
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,481
Whatever meat powder is,
it worked on this dog.

453
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,062
Okay, he put
the meat powder in there

454
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,524
and it produced an unconditioned
response in the dog, which was?

455
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,234
Salivation! All right?

456
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,615
Now, who can give me
another example

457
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,163
of an unconditioned
stimulus response pair

458
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,831
that happens
to you every day?

459
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,327
It's probably happening
to some of you right now.

460
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,413
How about sex?

461
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,209
Sure, you know,

462
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,329
you see an attractive member
of the opposite gender,

463
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,380
you have
an automatic response.

464
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,460
You don't have
to think about it.

465
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,341
Mick Jagger wrote
a song about it.

466
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,797
"Oh, when
they call your name,

467
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,848
"I salivate like
a Pavlov dog."

468
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,849
Thank you very much.
Class dismissed.

469
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,367
Doctor Welbrock.

470
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,286
This is my son Mason.
Oh...

471
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,114
Mason, this is
Dr. Welbrock.

472
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,244
Your son.

473
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,121
Now see, I thought
this was a boy genius

474
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,619
who was taking my college course.

475
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,096
He wasn't feeling well today, so
I thought I'd bring him with me.

476
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,123
Uh...

477
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,008
No fever.
It's a con job.

478
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,883
I can tell because I have a nine-year-old
son, he pulls this all the time.

479
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,464
Same kind of deal.

480
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,799
Hey, you play soccer?
No.

481
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,850
Neither does my boy. He hates soccer.
He likes computers.

482
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,678
My 11-year-old daughter
loves soccer!

483
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,001
Who can figure?

484
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,806
Maybe we can get all you
guys together sometime, huh?

485
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,391
Maybe, yeah.

486
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,560
Well, you ready to go?

487
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,644
Yeah.

488
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,942
Nice to meet you, Mason.
Nice to meet you, too.

489
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,240
And thanks for
coming to my class.

490
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,241
Olivia.

491
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,991
Nice kid.
Thanks.

492
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:53,084
So, you think, uh, Grandma might be
available for a little babysitting?

493
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,331
Maybe.

494
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,756
Really?
Oh, yeah.

495
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,378
Well, great.

496
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,838
Dead <i>man, dead man,</i> wake up!

497
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,265
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, you're alive!</i>

498
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,442
My turn.
Kids, they're here!

499
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,736
- They're home, they're home!
- Come on!

500
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,116
Hurry, hurry.

501
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,662
Hi!
Hi!

502
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,129
Oh! We're here!

503
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,332
How was it? How was it?
Hey! We've returned!

504
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,009
Honey, it's so good
to see you.

505
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,758
Hi, Dad!
Samantha, Mason. Hello.

506
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,340
Thank you.
That's very nice.

507
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,425
Hey, Mom.
How are you?

508
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,760
Oh! Mom, Mom!

509
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,096
They give you trouble?
Look at the sign we made.

510
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,300
- Samantha and I made it all ourselves.
- Yeah.

511
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,024
I know the boys helped
you with that a lot.

512
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,022
No, not at all!

513
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,774
Okay.
There you go.

514
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,901
Pass out the goodies.
This is for the girls.

515
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,074
Don't worry, we got you some absinthe.
It's in the...

516
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,241
Let's pour.

517
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,739
You take this
big elevator up,

518
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,070
and when we got
to the top,

519
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,155
we flew
a paper airplane off.

520
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,536
- And what happened?
- It flew!

521
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,617
It flew away,
it went for miles.

522
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,332
Went under the Arc de Triomphe, you know.

523
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,630
Oh, did you guys kiss
under the Bridge of Sighs?

524
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,838
Yes.
Yes, we did.

525
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,882
Mom, can we see
your wedding ring?

526
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,304
Oh, sure.

527
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,048
Wow.

528
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,727
Technically,
that's a fancy step cut

529
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,804
surrounded by
miniature brilliant.

530
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,681
I wish we could've
gone to Europe.

531
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,811
Yeah.

532
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,400
Yeah, we'll go as
a family next time.

533
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,772
But you didn't
miss much, really.

534
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,943
We just stayed
in the hotel room

535
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,441
the whole time
playing video games.

536
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,522
Really?

537
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,988
And the hotels are really
small and really old.

538
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,068
Squeaky.

539
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,368
Can I get
you anything else?

540
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,787
Would you like to see
a dessert menu?

541
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,954
Listen, I told you
to put that away.

542
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,630
Would you put that
in your purse, please?

543
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,998
Computer games at the table. Yes,
uh, please, another bottle of wine.

544
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,085
- Um, Coke.
- Um, you know what?

545
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,965
Mason, you're okay
with water.

546
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,838
No more Cokes.
Thank you.

547
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,117
And how about you? Did
you finish your science project'?

548
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,051
Not quite yet.

549
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,058
Well, did you work on it? Did you
build anything or plan anything or...

550
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,428
A little. Did he work
on it at all, Mindy?

551
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:18,804
No.

552
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,866
Did he sit around playing video
games with Mason the whole time?

553
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,187
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

554
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,280
You were supposed to finish
that by the time I got back.

555
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,402
Remember?

556
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,241
<i>Hey-</i>

557
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,161
Grievous is the best, man.

558
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,988
Yoda!
No, Yoda is, man!

559
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,323
Yoda! Yoda, man.

560
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,532
He has four arms.

561
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,162
Yoda, represent!

562
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,416
I hate Miss Burnsby. Everybody's
been saying she's lesbian.

563
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,918
She is. She hit on Stacey.

564
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,920
Man, that's gross.

565
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,092
Think it's true?

566
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,671
She's always walking
in the locker room.

567
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,763
I think I still have
a couple of those...

568
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,927
Hey, Paul, tell us a joke.

569
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,517
Damn. Fuck.
Go to hell. Ass.

570
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,539
Oh! Blew you up.

571
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,663
Heck, man.
That was not fair.

572
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,748
No, actually it was.

573
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,454
That's, like,
the fairest thing ever.

574
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,964
Where are you?

575
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,464
Ooh, once again,
I take you down.

576
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,880
The <i>Mask?</i>

577
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,465
<i>Uh...
Three Musketeers?</i>

578
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,346
First word.

579
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,802
- Chicken. Bird.
- Chicken. Bird.

580
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:43,889
Second word.

581
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,147
Hood. Big hair. <i>Robin</i> Hood! Ah!

582
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,195
Brilliant child!

583
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,444
Second word.

584
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,818
Blanket?

585
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,113
Hey,
you can't use props!

586
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,622
Hey, hey, hey!

587
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,917
Cut it out. Judges speak.
No props. No props.

588
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,121
Can't use props. You can do it
without that. Think, think, think.

589
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,668
- Um, folding.
- Bunch!

590
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,627
The Gathered'? Folded.
Is it like... Um...

591
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,431
It's just messing around
with a blanket. Wrinkling it...

592
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,632
<i>A Wrinkle In Time!
Wrinkle.</i>

593
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,183
Whoo!

594
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,373
What are the guards of Azkaban?

595
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,744
Dementors.
Ah...

596
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,539
<i>Front of the line,
are you ready?</i>

597
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,216
<i>Count down with me,
ladies and gentlemen Ten!</i>

598
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,633
<i>Nine! Eight! Seven!</i>

599
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,966
<i>Six! Five! Four!</i>

600
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,972
<i>Three! Two! One!</i>

601
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,303
<i>Let's go!</i>

602
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,387
<i>Whoo!</i>

603
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,153
Thank you.

604
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,605
Thanks.

605
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,954
All righty. Here we go.

606
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,795
No, no, no. Back up and take a
practice swing first, remember?

607
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,753
Nice and easy. Sweep the floor.
Sweep the floor.

608
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,382
That's good.

609
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,764
Don't swing
too hard, Randy.

610
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,386
He always
swings too hard.

611
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,768
Hey! All right!
Very good!

612
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,727
Back your feet up a little bit.
Yeah, like that.

613
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,432
Now you're gonna hit
it straighter. Okay.

614
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,033
All right, go up
and hit it. That's good.

615
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,812
Nice slow swing is
gonna be better for you.

616
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,614
All right!

617
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,443
I don't know, man,
you must've been...

618
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,528
See, your feet
are too open, Randy.

619
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,614
Nice and natural.

620
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,035
Yes! Go! All right!

621
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,371
Give me five! Good
putt, son, good putt.

622
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,548
Did you see that, Randy?
That's the way to do it!

623
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,920
All right.

624
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,213
Birdie putt.

625
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,768
God damn it.
Son of a bitch.

626
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,517
Get my clubs, would you?
Get the ball.

627
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,945
This is just in case we
have guests this weekend.

628
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,117
He always <i>says</i> that,
but we never have guests.

629
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,282
Samantha, I think
I heard your dad pull up.

630
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,313
All right.

631
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,899
You guys finish
your chores'?

632
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,404
Not quite.

633
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,197
Just about.

634
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,867
How about
the dusting, Sam?

635
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,619
I haven't done that yet.

636
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,621
Well, I saw you working
on your art project.

637
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,702
You had time to finish
your little art project,

638
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,537
but you didn't have time
to finish your chores?

639
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,712
I thought we talked
about that.

640
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,290
Dad, it's fine,
I can finish the dusting.

641
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,420
No, it's not fine, Mindy.

642
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,002
You have your own chores to
do and Sam has hers to do.

643
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,837
Huh? It's simple.

644
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,724
Poor choice there, Sam.
And hurry up.

645
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,560
Mason!

646
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,980
Your dad's here.

647
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,152
You guys aren't setting
any speed records, are you?

648
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,657
What'd you do, get about half done?
Hey, hey, hey.

649
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,285
So, did you finish?

650
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,365
No.

651
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,039
Is the job complete?

652
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,497
So, what are you
gonna be doing tomorrow?

653
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,672
Same thing, right?

654
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,546
Yeah.
Okay. Go.

655
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,921
Bye, Mom.

656
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,052
Bye, babe,
I love you.

657
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,842
Bye, Mama.

658
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,894
Bye, honey.
Have fun with your dad.

659
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,437
Just a minute, Mason.

660
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,479
The boys didn't
finish raking leaves.

661
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,560
Samantha did not
finish dusting.

662
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,859
So tomorrow,
when they come home,

663
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,155
instead of swimming
and all the other

664
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,403
little stuff that
they want to do,

665
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,608
they're going to do
their chores. Right?

666
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,692
Right.

667
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,256
Okay, guys,
you had this conversation,

668
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,494
you understand?
Tomorrow?

669
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,073
Okay.

670
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,041
Thank you. I just wanted
you to back me up on that

671
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,196
so I'm not the only one
yelling at them all the time.

672
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,204
Okay, I back you up.
You guys got that?

673
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,378
We all agree, everybody agrees, right?
Tomorrow, chores'?

674
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,960
They don't hear it. Goes in
one ear and out the other.

675
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,220
But, Dad, I mean,
dusting is pointless.

676
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,218
It's not pointless,
you just don't like to do it.

677
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,850
But, I mean,
who dusts anymore?

678
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,056
You do when we ask you to!

679
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,388
And don't... Olivia, don't
let her back talk me

680
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,271
in front of the other kids,
please. Thank you.

681
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,478
Samantha, please.

682
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,606
Whatever!

683
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,903
Bye-bye.
Have a wonderful weekend.

684
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,105
Sam...

685
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,445
Okay. Bye, guys. Love you.

686
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,995
I'm sorry, but I thought
we talked about it.

687
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,950
You have to draw a line,
you have to back it up.

688
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,579
Okay. It's just you have
so many lines, Bill.

689
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,914
Everything's a line.

690
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,034
Hey, Randy!
Hey.

691
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,330
Bye.
Bye.

692
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,415
Hey, you two.
How you doing?

693
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,920
Shotgun.
Ooh!

694
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,301
Here, let me get
these bags here.

695
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,424
You doing okay,
darling'?

696
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,846
Yeah.
Yeah?

697
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,431
What about you, cowboy?
Pretty good.

698
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,974
Yeah?

699
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,512
All right. Let's roll!

700
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,023
You guys ready
for the big game?

701
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,690
Yeah.

702
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,610
Sam, who are the Astros
playing tonight?

703
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,740
I don't know.

704
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,412
The Milwaukee Brewers,
all right?

705
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,767
Get to know 'em,
get to hate 'em.

706
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,532
Mason. How you been? Huh?
How was your week'?

707
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,663
Pretty good.

708
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,289
Yeah? What you been up to?

709
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,291
Not much.
No?

710
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,622
You still hanging
with that kid Joe?

711
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,457
Yeah. And he's still
your best friend?

712
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,921
Yeah, I guess.

713
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,710
Okay.

714
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,073
How about you?
How was your week?

715
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,129
Fine.

716
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,714
What you been up to?

717
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,798
Nothing, really.

718
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,893
You, um, still working on
that sculpture project?

719
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,970
Yeah. Almost finished.
Yeah?

720
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,055
What's it of?

721
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,644
Nothing.

722
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,360
All right, no, no, no.

723
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:50,157
No, that is not how we are going
to talk to one another. All right?

724
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:54,156
No, I will not be that guy. You cannot
put me in that category, all right?

725
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,497
"The biological father that I
spend every other week with,

726
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,290
"and I make
polite conversation

727
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,414
"while he drives me places
and buys me shit."

728
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,541
No! Talk to me.

729
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,330
Samantha, how was your week?

730
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,256
"Uh, I don't know, Dad,
it was kinda tough.

731
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,175
"Billy and Ellen broke up,
and Ellen's kinda mad at me,

732
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,378
cause she saw me talking
to Billy in the cafeteria.

733
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,838
"And you remember that
sculpture I was working on,

734
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,218
"well, it was a unicorn,

735
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,267
"and the horn broke off,
so now it's a zebra," okay?

736
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,348
"But I still think I'm
gonna get an 'A,"' right?

737
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,304
Mason, uh,
how was your week?

738
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,186
"Well, Dad, you know
it was kinda tough.

739
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,107
"Joey's kind of a jerk,
actually.

740
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,436
"He stole some cigarettes from his
mom and he wanted me to smoke 'em,

741
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,896
"but I said no
because I knew

742
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,898
"what a hard time you had
quitting smoking, Dad."

743
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,782
How 'bout that?
Is that so hard?

744
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,737
Dad, these questions
are kind of hard to answer.

745
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,788
What is so hard to answer about
what sculpture are you making?

746
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,289
It's abstract.

747
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,200
Okay. Okay, that's good.

748
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,875
See, I didn't know that.

749
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,249
I didn't know you were even
interested in abstract art.

750
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,205
I'm not.
They make us do it.

751
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,507
But, Dad,
why is it all on us, though?

752
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,584
What about you?
How was your week?

753
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,965
Who do you hang out with?

754
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,297
Do you have a girlfriend?
What have you been up to?

755
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,591
I see your point.

756
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,387
So we should just let it
happen more natural, right?

757
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,063
That's what you're saying?

758
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,187
Okay, that's what we'll do.

759
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,358
Starting now.

760
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,077
Check this out.

761
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,587
That would be a...

762
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,292
That would be a Magnificent Owl.
Caligo atreus.

763
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,009
- What's that one? Look at this.
- Whoa!

764
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,086
What kind is that?

765
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,673
That looks like a Zebra Longwing.
All right.

766
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,841
Cool.

767
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,803
This one's incredible.
That's the owl one, right?

768
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,309
Yeah.
Magnificent Owl.

769
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,808
I think he went
pee-pee on you, bud.

770
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,861
One, two, three,
four, five.

771
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,007
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

772
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,555
Yo, Mase, look at me here. Make a
diamond with your hands, all right'?

773
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,393
Fingers and thumbs.

774
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,941
Keep your hands soft.

775
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,860
Sam. Very nice.

776
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,109
That's how you want to
catch it, just like that.

777
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,189
Even when you're running,

778
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,899
that's what you're thinking
about, that diamond.

779
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,984
That diamond
and soft hands.

780
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,445
There it is.

781
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,413
No, no, no.

782
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,081
No!
Yes!

783
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,258
Don't let her get...
No, no, no!

784
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,587
Let's go, Roger!

785
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,559
That's it, Roger!
Yeah!

786
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,606
Guy's incredible.
He's unhittable this year.

787
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,646
Now, just so you know, what
we're watching here is history.

788
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,925
Now, you see
this guy out here?

789
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,861
This dude is
like 43 years old,

790
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,031
and he's striking out
guys half his age.

791
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:22,612
This guy's ERA is 1.47, all right?
Can you believe that?

792
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,156
Now, if the Astros could just get a
few runs, maybe we'd win a game.

793
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,954
Dad, do you
have a job'?

794
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,709
Why would you
ask me that?

795
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,132
I don't know.
Mom wanted to know,

796
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,050
and I didn't know what the answer was.
Morn wanted to know.

797
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,878
All right.
Well, you can tell Mom

798
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,508
that I just happen
to have passed

799
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,473
my second actuarial exam,
all right?

800
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,978
So, tell her that.
How's she doing?

801
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,054
Is she finishing school?

802
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,139
Yep, all A's.

803
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,226
All A's, huh? Like mother,
like daughter, right?

804
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,749
He got that!
That's out...

805
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,171
Oh! Oh!

806
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,790
Yeah! Look at that!

807
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,375
Yeah!

808
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,838
Mason! Yes!

809
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,844
Whoo!

810
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,847
Yeah!

811
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,854
Yeah!

812
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,532
Whoo!

813
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,991
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Samantha!

814
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,201
Hey. What's up, Jimmy?

815
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,833
What's going on,
Mason, man?

816
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,456
<i>Astros won.</i>

817
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,790
You went to the game?

818
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,125
What, I'm the only one
with any arms around here?

819
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,881
Nobody else can
carry anything? Huh?

820
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,169
Help their old man out?

821
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,674
What you watching?

822
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,133
Oh, come on, Jimmy, man! You knew
the kids were coming this weekend.

823
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,139
Can't you just help
me out a little bit?

824
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,470
I'm sorry, muffin.

825
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,954
Yeah, don't
"muffin" me, all right?

826
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,172
Don't put me
in that position.

827
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,600
I'm not your fuckin'
Tony Randall.

828
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,021
Dad, it's always a mess.

829
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,775
It was not a mess
this morning. Okay?

830
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,655
I mowed the lawn.

831
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,573
Oh, yeah? Great.

832
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,110
Oh, come on, man!
Turn this shit off.

833
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,366
Come on,
give me that thing.

834
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,704
Did you watch the game?
No.

835
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,501
Lane won it
with a three-run homer.

836
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,294
It was beautiful,
wasn't it?

837
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,085
Sam lost her mind.

838
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,757
She's a huge Astros fan.

839
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,258
Sure.

840
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,138
<i>Saturday night

What?

00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,756
Did you brush
your teeth?

860
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,338
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

861
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,931
You gonna fall asleep with
those things in your head?

862
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,007
Maybe.

863
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,259
Yeah, well, try not to, all right?
Okay.

864
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,345
Want me to turn off the light?
Okay. Sure.

865
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,481
Good night, Sam.
Night, Dad.

00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,978
Good night, Sam.
Good night, Jimmy.

867
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,031
Hey. That was
a fun day, right?

868
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,990
Yeah, it was. Sorry.

869
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,448
Why? That Mason had to
be there, you know.

870
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,115
Good night.
Good night.

871
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,497
Dad?

872
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,760
There's no, like, real
magic in the world, right?

873
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,430
What do you mean?

874
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,013
You know,
like elves and stuff.

875
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,557
People just made that up.

876
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,142
Oh, I don't know.

877
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,360
I mean, what makes you think
that elves are any more magical

878
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,436
than something
like a whale?

879
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,320
You know what I mean? What
if I told you a story about

880
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,572
how underneath the ocean,

881
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,622
there was this
giant sea mammal

882
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,576
that used sonar
and sang songs

883
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,504
and it was so big that its
heart was the size of a car

884
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,378
and you could crawl
through the arteries?

885
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,967
I mean, you'd think that
was pretty magical, right?

886
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,419
Yeah.

887
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,924
But, like,
right this second,

888
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:40,103
there's, like, no elves
in the world, right?

889
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,438
No. Technically,
no elves.

890
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,824
Love you, guys. All right.
Be well. See you, Dad.

891
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,293
Have a great week. Sam,
I'll see you next weekend?

892
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,041
All right. Oh, yeah, that's right.
What?

893
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,122
Suzy has a birthday party
next Saturday.

894
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,207
A sleepover?
Yeah.

895
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,042
All right. I'll talk
to your mom about it.

896
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,297
Bye, Dad.
Don't worry about it, okay?

897
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,299
Have a great week. Okay.
Had a great time.

898
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,309
Oh, man.

899
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,795
How do you guys not know how to do this?

900
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,062
I'll make you some bookmarks.
Just a second. Pictures...

901
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,315
Ooh. She looks nice.

902
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,364
Randy, Mason, Dad wants
you guys downstairs.

903
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,533
Why?
You're getting haircuts.

904
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,689
This is gonna
look so much better.

905
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,899
You're gonna look like a man,
instead of like a little girl.

906
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,731
You're taking the eyebrows
off next, right, Byron?

907
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,963
Mason, we're leaving.

908
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,833
You're not sick.

909
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,227
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Mom.

910
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,555
Where's Mason?

911
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,806
He doesn't feel too good. I don't
think he's going to school.

912
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,267
He's totally faking it.

913
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,935
Bye.

914
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,650
Mason, what's going on?

915
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,830
I don't feel good.

916
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,185
Yeah, well,
your head feels fine.

917
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,666
So get your <i>ass</i>
out of bed.

918
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:08,902
I'm gonna drive
you to school.

919
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,583
You got five minutes,
and don't make me late.

920
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:32,063
I mean, he didn't even ask!
He just cut it.

921
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,102
It's my hair!

922
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,520
Well, no wonder you were angry.
I'd be angry, too.

923
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,523
I look like a Martian now.

924
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,327
Honey, you know what? I'm gonna
talk to him about it later. Okay?

925
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,667
Yeah, I tried to call you, but
you didn't answer your phone.

926
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,879
I'm so sorry. I've been
so busy with school.

927
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,882
For what it's worth, it's
hair and it will grow back.

928
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,469
And now I can see your pretty
eyes and your foxy face.

929
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,058
Why did you even marry him?

930
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,225
He's such a jerk!

931
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,102
Well, Bill has
his good qualities.

932
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:16,277
You know, nobody's perfect.
And now we have a family.

933
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,022
We already had a family.

934
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,251
I pledge allegiance
to the flag

935
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,170
of the United States
of America...

936
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,466
...and to the
Republic for which it stands,

937
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,752
one nation, under God,

938
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,716
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.

939
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,517
Please join me
in the Texas Pledge.

940
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,929
Honor the Texas flag.

941
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,514
I pledge allegiance to thee,

942
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,358
Texas one and indivisible.

943
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,189
Thank you.
You may be seated.

944
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,946
All right.

945
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,276
All right, class,
as you know,

946
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,532
we've been working on
our mythology projects,

947
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,330
and you're going to be writing
papers about gods and goddesses.

948
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,034
We've listed those gods and
goddesses here on the board.

949
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,539
We added a couple
of monsters

950
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,871
for some of you who might
be interested in that.

951
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,332
And you're going to write your
essay about your god and goddess,

952
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,133
and to make sure that
you cover everything,

953
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,711
let's make sure that we do all
of these things right here.

954
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,298
First of all, you need to name
your god or goddess,

955
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,511
and you need to include who,
what, when, where, why and how.

956
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,524
So make sure that
you cover all those things

957
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,229
when you're writing
your essay.

958
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,566
There's a bump
right there.

959
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,293
I'll see you later, guys.

960
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,495
Yeah.

961
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,768
- Mom, are you okay?
- What happened?

962
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,844
No.

963
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,353
Go in the house! Go! Go in the house!
Go in the house!

964
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,025
Your mother
had a little accident.

965
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,148
Now she's being dramatic.

966
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:27,029
Get off the fucking
floor, Olivia. For Christ's sake!

967
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,830
I'm having a drink
with my dinner.

968
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,377
Anybody else have
a problem with that?

969
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:24,707
Hmm?

970
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,883
Samantha?
No.

971
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,471
Mindy?

972
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,548
No.

973
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:36,890
I didn't think so.

974
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,403
You don't like me
much, do you, Mason?

975
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,572
That's okay. I don't like me either.

976
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,209
You think
that's funny? Huh?

977
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,625
You think that's fuckin' funny?

978
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,130
What's the matter, you
feeling a little left out?

979
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,804
Clean it up, God damn it!
Clean it up.

980
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,386
Bill! Clean it up, God damn it!

981
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,971
I hate squash!

982
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,064
Pearl.

983
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,694
<i>I'm gonna Pay You.</i>

984
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,071
<i>I'm working
three jobs right now.</i>

985
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,653
How many times can
you watch that, Mason?

986
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,780
It's funny.
I'm driving a cab.

987
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,167
<i>I'm inside with my buddy right
now just going over my résumé.</i>

988
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,289
<i>Okay, you know what?
You need to relax.</i>

989
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,715
<i>Look, why do you need your
money so fast? Come on.</i>

990
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:54,638
- Has he ever gotten this bad before?
- No.

991
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,340
But he's yelled a lot.

992
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,393
Yeah, but he hasn't
thrown and broken stuff.

993
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,405
<i>Yeah.
You're drunk. I knew it.</i>

994
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,105
<i>You're already drunk.</i>

995
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,393
Give me
your cell phones.

996
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,782
So nobody talked
to her, huh?

997
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,084
Mason?

998
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,124
No.

999
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,217
Mindy?
No.

1000
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,297
I believe you.

1001
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:44,976
Samantha?

1002
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,056
No.

1003
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,025
I didn't talk to her.
She left a message.

1004
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,449
What'd she say?

1005
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,196
Nothing much.

1006
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,579
What did she say?

1007
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,204
She said
she'd be back later.

1008
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,840
And that's all,
"I'll be back later," click?

1009
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,428
She said, "Stay in your rooms.
I'll be back later."

1010
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,552
I'll be back later, stay in your rooms.
And that's all? Hmm?

1011
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,932
Yeah.

1012
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,055
Where is she?

1013
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,811
I don't know.
Where is she?

1014
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:24,887
She didn't say!

1015
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,362
All right. Everybody,
get in the car.

1016
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,647
Hurry up!
Get in the car!

1017
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,078
It's still not working.

1018
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,250
Oh, bullshit.

1019
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,209
She took it all.

1020
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,923
All right, Randy,
go cash this.

1021
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:02,137
Tell them I'm not feeling well
or something. I don't know.

1022
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,223
Mason, go with him.

1023
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,556
Here. There's my ID.

1024
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,736
Hi, good afternoon, fellas.
What can I do for you today?

1025
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,908
Now what's this?

1026
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,582
Can't read this.

1027
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,750
Hey!

1028
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,454
This isn't you!
Who is this?

1029
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,748
It's our dad.

1030
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,126
He's not feeling well.

1031
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:41,388
Oh! Hey! Yeah, I know him.
Okay, here we go.

1032
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,883
Five hundred bucks.

1033
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,595
One, two, three, four...

1034
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,932
Five hundred bucks.
All right?

1035
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,394
Don't forget your dad's ID.

1036
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,902
Now take care of your dad now, son.
You only got the one.

1037
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,031
Damn it.

1038
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,625
Get outta the way.
Jesus Christ.

1039
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,377
God...

1040
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,258
Calm down!

1041
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,345
Samantha! Mason!

1042
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,183
Samantha!

1043
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,229
Where the hell
have you been?

1044
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,869
I'm leaving you, Bill.
We're moving out.

1045
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,732
I doubt that.

1046
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,314
Samantha, Mason!
Come down!

1047
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,276
No, mmm-mmm, don't think so.
Oh, who's this?

1048
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,038
- I'm not here for you!
- Oh, really?

1049
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,408
Oh, I know, you're here
to protect my wife from me.

1050
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,998
Well, thank you so much, you two.
Okay, stay back!

1051
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,580
Why don't you come inside here?
Huh? Come inside here.

1052
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,036
Where the hell
are you going?

1053
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,121
Get your ass upstairs!
You're not going anywhere.

1054
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,751
Stop! Come on!

1055
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,089
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Get upstairs!

1056
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,636
What the hell... Nobody's
going anywhere, God damn it!

1057
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,384
No, God damn it!
Stop it.

1058
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,589
Don't touch my kids!

1059
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,992
All right, take 'em.
Go on, go on.

1060
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,207
- Don't touch them!
- Take 'em.

1061
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,228
Take 'em then, just take 'em!
Get in the car.

1062
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,350
Go!

1063
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:17,025
Get upstairs! Olivia!

1064
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,694
Seat belts! Put your seat belts on.

1065
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,657
Where are we going?

1066
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,620
We're going to stay with Carol
and her family for a while.

1067
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,045
Don't look back.

1068
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,167
It's gonna be okay.

1069
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,386
<i>And we see that</i>

1070
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,643
<i>We're all in this together</i>

1071
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,984
<i>And it shows
When we stand hand in hand</i>

1072
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,694
Hey, Lee and Mason.
Guys, when you want

1073
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,738
to take a break,
here's a snack.

1074
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,196
...going on...

1075
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,460
<i>Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it loud</i>

1076
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,287
<i>Wildcats everywhere</i>

1077
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,963
<i>Wave your hands
up in the air</i>

1078
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,296
Abby, why don't you
come and help me with this?

1079
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,262
Why couldn't Randy
and Mindy come with us?

1080
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,844
I'm not their
legal guardian, honey.

1081
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,176
That would be kidnapping.
I can't just...

1082
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,852
What's gonna happen
to them?

1083
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,227
What happens when their legal
guardian is dangerous and abusive?

1084
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,023
I don't know, honey.

1085
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:42,273
I called their mom. I called
the Child Protective Services.

1086
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,066
I have you and your brother.

1087
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,693
We are in
a dangerous situation.

1088
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,524
You're my responsibility.

1089
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,243
Are we ever gonna
see them again?

1090
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,992
I don't know.

1091
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,323
I hope so.

1092
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:56,847
How much longer
are we gonna be here?

1093
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,583
Not long. We're...

1094
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,965
I don't...

1095
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,133
I don't know. I don't
have the answer, baby.

1096
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,921
Listen.

1097
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,804
We are happy to have you
here as long as you want.

1098
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,390
As long as you need.

1099
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,896
This is fun for us, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.

1100
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,818
Yeah, it's like
having a big sister?

1101
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,645
Like having a brother.

1102
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,125
We're gonna
help out, right?

1103
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,687
You're not even gonna
know we're here.

1104
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,192
Okay.

1105
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,039
Mom, this is awful.

1106
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,792
You're dumping me in some
parking lot of this school

1107
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,373
where I don't
even know anyone!

1108
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,926
I'm leaving all my friends, and I
didn't even get to say goodbye!

1109
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,378
I don't know where to go!

1110
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,964
Samantha, you go
right through that door.

1111
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,967
The office is right there.
They're expecting you.

1112
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,099
They're gonna give you
your schedule.

1113
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,301
Here's your lunch money.

1114
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,103
I will pick you up
right here at 3:30.

1115
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:04,189
I'm wearing dirty clothes because you
wouldn't even let us get our stuff!

1116
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,855
We don't even have
a place to live!

1117
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,360
This sucks!

1118
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:14,115
Samantha, I'm doing
the best I can!

1119
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,284
And you're right,
it sucks!

1120
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,617
But it doesn't suck half as
much <i>as</i> having a drunk fool

1121
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,372
slam your head
against a wall!

1122
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,745
So cut your
horseshit attitude!

1123
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,706
Put your seat belt on!

1124
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:35,678
You know, if you need anything,
I'm in Room 112, right?

1125
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,758
Okay.

1126
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,011
This is Mrs. Darby's room.

1127
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,972
Oh, honey,
it's gonna be okay.

1128
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,147
Mom.

1129
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,435
Dude,
did you see that?

1130
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,359
That concert was awful.

1131
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:53,067
Hook, I mean, when he smashed that
board against that microphone...

1132
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,912
Are you Mason?
Yeah.

1133
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,867
Hi, I'm Mrs. Darby.
I'm glad to meet you.

1134
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,872
Why don't you sit here?

1135
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,665
Kenny! Off.

1136
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,745
Yes, ma'am.

1137
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,207
Kenny, this is Mason,

1138
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,090
and I want you to show
him around today, okay?

1139
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,794
Got it.

1140
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:15,055
Hey, dude.
Welcome to the suck.

1141
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,549
Everybody, listen up!

1142
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,389
We have a new student
joining us today.

1143
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,436
His name is Mason,
he's sitting in the back row.

1144
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,684
Kenny's going to be his buddy,
but I want each one of you

1145
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,019
to take the time today
to introduce yourselves

1146
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,981
and welcome him
to school. Okay?

1147
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,699
All right'?
Let's get started.

1148
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,728
What?

1149
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:06,973
Oh, hi.

1150
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,789
Can I put an Obama sign
in your yard?

1151
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,857
Do I look like a Barack
Hussein Obama supporter?

1152
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,110
No.

1153
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,151
This is private property.
Get off.

1154
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,236
I could shoot you!

1155
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,784
What a dick.

1156
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,915
He had a Confederate flag
on his house.

1157
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,497
I love it.

1158
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,174
Young Obama supporters out
on the trail, this is great!

1159
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,127
Are you doing this
through your school?

1160
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,757
Um, our dad's
a big supporter.

1161
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,095
Oh, that's great.

1162
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,926
I mean, we have just got to pull
together to get this win, right?

1163
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,009
Yeah.

1164
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,187
Ah, I just
love him so much!

1165
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,935
I have these dreams
where I'm just kissing him,

1166
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,265
'cause I just
love him so much!

1167
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,645
He's so cute, isn't he?

1168
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,976
Yeah.

1169
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,061
You know, I made these
T-shirts for my kids.

1170
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,942
"My Mama's For Obama."

1171
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,021
Do you like it?
Yeah.

1172
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,782
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

1173
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,030
- Thanks for the sign!
- No problem.

1174
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,445
All right! Looks good!

1175
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:05,619
How many
you got left, two?

1176
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,326
All right, all right, we're done.
Let's get out of here.

1177
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,786
Come on, Sam.

1178
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,040
Go get that McCain sign,
would you?

1179
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,415
What? Get the McCain sign.
Go rip it up, come on.

1180
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,043
Get it, get it, get it,
go, go, go!

1181
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,182
Good job, good job.
Proud of you, son.

1182
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,205
You guys
are gonna get us arrested.

1183
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,515
Look,
I'm a patriot, all right?

1184
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,225
And sometimes in this life
you gotta fight.

1185
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,064
And what is it that you do
at these parties?

1186
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:42,411
I don't know. Talk,
dance, listen to music.

1187
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,829
Uh-huh. And that's more fun
to you than going camping

1188
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,532
with your brother and
your father who love you.

1189
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,084
Yes. Sorry.

1190
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,745
Wow. ls there gonna
be alcohol there?

1191
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,081
Probably not.

1192
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,917
- Maybe some of the seniors.
Mmm-hmm.

1193
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,551
I know what this party is.

1194
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,924
The parents are
out of town, right?

1195
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,006
Somebody's scored
a keg, right?

1196
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,683
You guys are gonna have a good
time, trash the whole house.

1197
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:06,851
Right? Am I right?
No.

1198
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,179
No, Dad.
Amy's really responsible.

1199
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,513
Mmm-hmm.

1200
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,599
Who's gonna be there?

1201
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,686
Marie, Christine, Amy.
Everyone.

1202
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,815
Is that guy on your Facebook
page, is he gonna be there?

1203
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,532
Who?

1204
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,407
Come on, the guy that's got
his arm wrapped around you,

1205
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,033
with his hair
over his eyes.

1206
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,204
Garret?

1207
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,282
Garret. Is that his name?
All right.

1208
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,460
Is Garret gonna be there?

1209
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,626
Probably.

1210
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,000
Probably. Uh-huh.
You see?

1211
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,382
I learn more about her
from her Facebook page

1212
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,302
than I do from our
scintillating conversation.

1213
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,470
Is he your boyfriend?

1214
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,631
Kind of.

1215
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,430
Have you met him? Has he
been around the house?

1216
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,556
Sometimes.

1217
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,308
Sometimes? Zzz?

1218
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,311
You have a boyfriend!

1219
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,184
Wow.

1220
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,778
Have you heard
of Sarah Palin?

1221
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,230
Yes.

1222
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,690
What's the one thing
you know about

1223
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,133
Sarah Palin's
17-year-old daughter?

1224
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,785
She's pregnant?
That's right.

1225
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,613
And what is the one thing
that you are not going to be

1226
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,915
in a couple of years
when you turn 17?

1227
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,701
Pregnant?
That's right!

1228
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,537
All right, now,
what are the two ways

1229
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,917
that you can achieve
that goal?

1230
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,380
First is

1231
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,418
not have any sex, okay?

1232
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,845
That's the first way, okay?
Just not engage in that.

1233
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,218
That did not work out very
well for your mother and me.

1234
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,258
And what's the second way?

1235
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,467
Where you going?
Bathroom.

1236
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:30,598
You don't have to go
to the bathroom.

1237
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:33,146
Sit down, Mason,
just sit down.

1238
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,598
What's the second way?

1239
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,268
Huh?

1240
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,024
Has your mother talked to
you guys about this stuff?

1241
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,104
No, Dad!

1242
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,747
No, come on, has she
talked to you about

1243
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,028
contraception?

1244
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,652
Huh?

1245
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,362
What, has she...
Condoms?

1246
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,289
She talked about that?
No, Dad, please, stop.

1247
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,536
What?

1248
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,206
Does Garret have a condom?
Oh, God!

1249
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,790
Dad! What? Come on.

1250
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,838
Sam, we have to be able to
talk about this, all right?

1251
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,665
Come on, we do. We can
do it, we can do it.

1252
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,341
Just stay with me here,
all right?

1253
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:05,136
It's as hard for me <i>as</i> it is for you.
But seriously, all right?

1254
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,680
I read an article in the paper
the other day that said

1255
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:12,056
that although US teenagers are
not the most sexually active,

1256
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:15,685
we have the highest rate
of teenage pregnancy, okay?

1257
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,098
<i>Hey-</i>

1258
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,816
Oh, hey, Tammy, how you doing?
What's going on?

1259
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:19,892
Nice to see you.

1260
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,523
Oh, yeah, good to see you. Yeah.

1261
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,571
Um, Tammy, this is my
daughter Samantha. Hey.

1262
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,364
And this is, uh,
Mason Junior right here.

1263
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,654
- Mason Junior.
- Tammy.

1264
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:27,733
Say hi.
Hi.

1265
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,699
Hi, Mason, nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you guys.

1266
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,325
What're you doing here?

1267
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,827
I'm just here
with some friends.

1268
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,830
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

1269
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:36,956
What are you guys up to?

1270
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,161
Um, we're going camping.

1271
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,212
Well, no, this one
is not going camping.

1272
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,756
This one is going
to a party.

1273
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,424
Oh, fun.

1274
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,381
But we, the men,
are going camping.

1275
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,712
The boys are going camping.

1276
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,262
All right, very nice.

1277
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:52,012
Well, uh, we still on for tomorrow?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1278
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,059
No, I'll drop him off at 7:00
and then I'll just call you.

1279
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,182
Okay,
Right?

1280
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,355
Great. It was really
nice meeting you both.

1281
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,431
Take care.

1282
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,768
Talk to you soon. Bye. I'll see you.
I'll see you.

1283
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,567
Don't look at me
like that, all right?

1284
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,945
Look, just to finish
the point, okay?

1285
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:12,575
I was 23 when your mom had
you, all right'? So was she.

1286
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:13,826
All right, and we didn't
put ourselves

1287
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,829
in the best position
to be great parents.

1288
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,785
And I wish that...

1289
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,296
I wish I were a better parent
to you guys, all right?

1290
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:26,252
And I hope that you
can learn from my mistakes, okay?

1291
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:28,712
All right. So wear a condom, okay?
Oh!

1292
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,093
Or get Garret to...

1293
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,298
I don't know,
whatever.

1294
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,854
Listen to this song,
all right?

1295
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,812
<i>I try to stay busy</i>

1296
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,314
Just straight-up...
The lyrics in this,

1297
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,070
straight-up
old-school country song.

1298
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,826
<i>I do the dishes
I mow the lawn</i>

1299
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,820
Listen to
the production of this.

1300
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,747
Production's like
<i>Abbey Road</i> or something.

1301
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:03,417
<i>Even though I know
You're not coming home</i>

1302
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,748
You know,
his old woman's gone.

1303
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,833
Straight-up.
Nothing fancy.

1304
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,510
<i>I try to keep
the house nice and neat</i>

1305
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,971
<i>Make my bed
I change the sheets</i>

1306
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:22,390
<i>I even learned how to use
the washing machine</i>

1307
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:28,860
<i>Keeping things clean
Doesn't change anything</i>

1308
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,352
Yeah, I think she's about
to get her master's degree.

1309
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,280
Well, then she's gonna start
applying for teaching jobs?

1310
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,611
I think she already has.

1311
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:35,866
Really? Where?

1312
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,071
All over.

1313
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,582
All over Texas?
Yeah.

1314
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:42,337
Well, if you gotta move, you gotta
move, you know? It's no big deal.

1315
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,372
We can handle that. I'll still
come get you every other weekend.

1316
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,838
I mean, unless she moves
500 miles away or something,

1317
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,516
it'll just be a little bit
more car time.

1318
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,795
No big deal.

1319
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,175
I'm just kind of
sick of moving.

1320
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,676
Well, I bet you are.

1321
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:55,757
But, you know,
you never know.

1322
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,308
I might have
to move. Right?

1323
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,306
I'm working for this
insurance company now.

1324
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,558
These places get bought
and sold all the time.

1325
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,107
You know,
we'll just roll with it.

1326
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:05,559
I thought you were
a musician.

1327
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:06,768
I am,

1328
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,946
but life is expensive,
you know?

1329
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,565
Guy's got to
be responsible.

1330
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,775
What do you think?

1331
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,030
Hey! Hey!

1332
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:17,991
Oh, you!

1333
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,574
Punk kid!
You got no respect!

1334
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,092
You know that redhead
at the bowling alley?

1335
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,420
Sure.
What about her?

1336
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,880
Do you
know her well?

1337
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,428
Uh, you know,
we've hung out a little bit.

1338
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,556
Is she your girlfriend?

1339
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,723
How do you mean?

1340
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:42,930
Like, have you kissed her?

1341
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,522
Urn...

1342
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,353
Yeah. Yeah,
I've kissed her.

1343
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,897
What about you?
Have you got a girlfriend?

1344
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,276
Sort of.

1345
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:55,863
Really?

1346
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,944
Have you, uh,
kissed her?

1347
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,455
Not really.

1348
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,957
Yeah? What have you done?

1349
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,249
Well,
we talked on the phone.

1350
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,372
Oh, yeah!

1351
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,748
How did that go?

1352
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:07,875
Pretty terrible.

1353
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:10,298
Why?

1354
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:13,339
Well, when we're at school,
we got plenty to talk about,

1355
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,091
but when we're alone
or on the phone,

1356
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,887
it's like we have
nothing in common.

1357
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,180
Nothing?

1358
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:22,010
She's not interested in
music or video games or...

1359
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,349
Three best movies this summer.
Right.

1360
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,181
<i>Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight
and Pineapple Express.</i>

1361
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,107
Yeah, what about 'em?
She said they all sucked.

1362
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,059
Okay, what's she
interested in?

1363
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,269
I don't know.

1364
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,733
Going to the mall with her
stupid friends?

1365
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,736
Well, is she cute?
Watch your step there.

1366
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,408
Yeah.
Yeah? All right.

1367
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,032
Well, here's what
you do, all right?

1368
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,623
First off, you gotta
ask her a lot of questions.

1369
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,542
Then you have to listen to
the answers, all right'?

1370
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,086
Actually be interested
in her, all right?

1371
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,379
If you can
do those things,

1372
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,254
you're gonna be light years
ahead of all the other guys.

1373
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,177
Okay. This is the best s'more I
ever made in my life, all right?

1374
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,422
This is absolute peak. Look at this.
Yeah. Yeah.

1375
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,757
Honey brown, no burn.

1376
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,960
Look at that, huh?

1377
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,427
Sell that in the store.
Mmm.

1378
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,933
That's like advertisement worthy.
Mmm-hmm.

1379
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,230
Advertisement quality.

1380
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,398
Yeah.

1381
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,225
Mmm.

1382
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,522
You think they ever will
make another Star <i>Wars?</i>

1383
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,777
I don't know. I think if they
were gonna make another one,

1384
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,483
that the period
where this game is set

1385
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:19,988
is where
it would have to be,

1386
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,240
'cause there's
nothing after, really.

1387
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,640
Yeah. No, Return of the <i>Jedi,</i> it's over.
There's nothing...

1388
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,869
Yeah, there's nothing else
to do there.

1389
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,459
You gonna turn Han Solo into a Sith Lord?

1390
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,894
Yeah. What are you gonna do?
Right.

1391
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,532
Good morning.
Morning.

1392
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,196
You gotta pee?

1393
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,280
Sure.
Mmm-hmm.

1394
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,199
Hit the campfire.

1395
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,580
Ancient Native
American custom.

1396
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,958
You're gonna give back to the
Earth what you take from it,

1397
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,256
and you don't burn
the forest down.

1398
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,263
Okay, guys,
have a good day!

1399
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,891
Mason, don't forget,
I have to teach late today.

1400
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,647
Sam's gonna pick you up.
Right, Sam? Yeah.

1401
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,861
All right.
Okay. Bye, guys.

1402
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,153
See you.

1403
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,362
Hey.

1404
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,205
That's what I was
talking to you about.

1405
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,079
Yeah. Good luck with that.

1406
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,625
See you, man.

1407
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,179
Don't bump into me!
Little bitch!

1408
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,262
I didn't!

1409
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,727
You calling me a liar?

1410
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:14,807
No.

1411
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,436
Don't act like you're
tough shit, motherfucker.

1412
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,859
I don't think pretty boy's
hair's good enough.

1413
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,782
Don't touch me, faggot!

1414
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,160
You're a fuckin' asshole.

1415
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:49,341
<i>Hey, Mason!</i>

1416
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,472
<i>Hey, Jill.</i>

1417
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,226
So, where're you going?

1418
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:55,431
Over to the college.

1419
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,270
What's going on there?

1420
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,693
My mom's a teacher.

1421
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:01,362
Oh, cool.
What does she teach?

1422
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,780
Psychology, I think.

1423
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,241
What're you up to?

1424
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:07,944
Oh, my mom
owns Needleworks.

1425
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,779
The arts and crafts
store over there.

1426
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,455
So I'm just
kinda hangin' out.

1427
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,490
But I'm supposed to be going
to the hospital soon.

1428
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,743
How come?

1429
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,832
You know Courtney?

1430
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,246
Girl with the dyed black hair
and the nose ring'?

1431
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,627
Wears Hot Topic
every day?

1432
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,208
I think so.

1433
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,010
We used to be
best friends growing up,

1434
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:26,929
but we've kind of
grown apart.

1435
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,094
She sorta got all emo,
she thinks I'm a prep,

1436
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,971
but I still consider
her a friend.

1437
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,427
Anyway, she cut
one of her wrists.

1438
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,263
I don't know how bad, but I
think I should go visit.

1439
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,394
So what're you reading?

1440
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,568
<i>Uh, it's Breakfast of Champions.
</i> Kurt <i>Vonnegut.</i>

1441
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,734
I think my older brother
likes him.

1442
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,694
<i>I'm reading To Kill a
Mockingbird for the third time.</i>

1443
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,242
My friends
make fun of me.

1444
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,115
I think I'm the only girl
in the whole school

1445
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,912
who doesn't like
the Twilight books.

1446
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,160
Have you read 'em?

1447
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,365
Sure haven't.

1448
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,079
I tried.

1449
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,831
But it was so cheesy!

1450
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,464
So, how do you
like San Marcos?

1451
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,374
I like it all right.

1452
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:07,087
It's a lot smaller than Houston,
but it seems pretty cool.

1453
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,511
Have you always
lived here?

1454
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:09,713
Yeah.

1455
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:11,140
If you want
the big city around here,

1456
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,593
you have to drive
to San Antonio or Austin.

1457
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,474
Have you been there yet?

1458
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,351
I went to San Antonio
for a day,

1459
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,979
but I haven't been
to Austin yet.

1460
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,856
That's where all
the high school kids go

1461
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,778
on weekends
for shows and stuff.

1462
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,697
That's what I've heard.

1463
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,820
So, are you going to
Shauna's party next weekend?

1464
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,948
Um, I think I heard about it.
I'm not really sure, though.

1465
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,120
Well, you should!

1466
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,447
Why's that?

1467
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,783
Well, LeeAnne has
a big crush on you,

1468
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,244
and I know she was
hoping you would go.

1469
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,203
You don't have
a girlfriend, do you?

1470
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:42,334
Not currently.

1471
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,960
Well then,
you should come.

1472
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,542
I'll tell Chase to
make sure you're there.

1473
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,796
Okay.

1474
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,132
But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that.
She'd kill me.

1475
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,463
I won't.

1476
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,715
Well, I better get going.

1477
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,220
See you later.
Bye.

1478
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:02,101
His cognitive theories,
his interviews with orphans,

1479
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,560
ethology theorists' work,

1480
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,986
and then he in turn

1481
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:09,532
was supported strongly by Harry
Harlow's rhesus monkey study.

1482
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,575
Now, you guys,
you gotta think,

1483
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,948
this is the 1950s,
this was radical!

1484
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,952
This flew in the face of
traditional learning theory,

1485
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:20,661
of B.F. Skinner's classical
and instrumental conditioning.

1486
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,879
Now, Bowlby's
gonna argue that

1487
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:28,464
human survival depends
on us falling in love.

1488
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:32,339
It depends on me falling
in love with my mother

1489
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,349
and my mother
falling in love with me.

1490
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,518
And if that doesn't happen,

1491
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,971
We're pretty much doomed.

1492
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,730
Now think about it.

1493
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,730
A tiger chases her tribe
out of a cave

1494
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,854
Now, an ideal mother goes,

1495
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,694
"My baby! I love you,
I'll protect you!"

1496
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:54,698
Or, "Well, you, why am I gonna pick you up?
You're gonna slow me down.

1497
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,283
"You are
tiger kibble!"

1498
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,913
So, next week,
we are gonna get into

1499
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:03,460
Bowlby's four stages
of attachment.

1500
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,375
Oh, oh... Uh, Professor
Douglas and I...

1501
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,001
Some of you might
have classes with Elena.

1502
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:10,460
She and I are hosting a little
pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place,

1503
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,467
so if anyone wants to come,
please stop by.

1504
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:16,090
I'm not the greatest cook.

1505
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,220
Thanks.

1506
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:28,314
Samantha!

1507
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,820
Why the hell didn't you pick up your
brother like you said you would?

1508
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,821
Okay. Mom... Mom, I know
what you're gonna say.

1509
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,323
She was running late
and we couldn't turn around.

1510
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:38,655
No, no! No excuses!

1511
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,581
The bottom line is you didn't do
what you said you were gonna do!

1512
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,330
You stranded your brother!

1513
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:46,037
It's embarrassing to ask
my friend to turn around

1514
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,714
and go get some kid
at the middle school.

1515
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,757
What do you mean "some kid"?
He's your brother!

1516
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,510
And you know what? We've
helped Janey out before.

1517
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,218
She lives right around the corner.
It's no big deal.

1518
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,469
Sorry.

1519
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,425
You know what, Samantha?

1520
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,682
You need to start thinking long
and hard about who you wanna be.

1521
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,184
Do you wanna be
a cooperative person

1522
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,776
who's compassionate and
helps people out...

1523
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,694
...or do you wanna be
a self-centered narcissist?

1524
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:14,069
You know what? You're right.
I am this horrible person.

1525
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,697
But, honestly,
he's not a baby anymore.

1526
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,277
You don't have to
treat him like one.

1527
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,115
He's in eighth grade, and he can
find his way home if he wants to.

1528
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,416
You know what?

1529
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:27,415
When Gabi leaves, you and
me are gonna have a chat.

1530
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,758
Awkward.

1531
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,715
Dude, that sucks.

1532
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,053
Hey, man, what's up?

1533
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,416
Hey. We're going
camping tonight.

1534
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:46,563
You in?

1535
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:47,731
Uh, who's going?

1536
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,810
My brother, one of his
friends, and Tony maybe.

1537
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,188
Yeah, let me check
with my mom.

1538
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,325
Mom, can I go camping
with Chase tonight?

1539
01:18:58,817 --> 01:18:59,818
Camping? Where?

1540
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,159
Uh, at that house that his family's
building. It's pretty much finished.

1541
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,828
Well, will any adults
be there?

1542
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:07,709
His brother's a senior.

1543
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,125
You have your cell phone?
Yeah.

1544
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:11,751
Is it charged?
Mmm-hmm.

1545
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:12,831
Okay, do me a favor.

1546
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,251
Leave his parents' number and
the address on the counter.

1547
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,460
Okay.

1548
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,386
Yeah! What
I'm talking about!

1549
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:22,466
That's it.

1550
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:23,550
You ready?
Check this shit out.

1551
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:26,308
That was all right, but
this is gonna be badass.

1552
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:28,060
All right, let me see.
Let me see what you can do.

1553
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,015
All right.
This is your face.

1554
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,355
I'm about to break
his face, right here.

1555
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:40,117
All right, man. All right, now check
this out. You might want to move.

1556
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,286
Ow, that'd be painful.

1557
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,293
In the kidneys, right?
The stomach? Something.

1558
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,128
Oh!

1559
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:53,998
Check this out, man.

1560
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,132
Pancreas.

1561
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,512
That shit's lethal.

1562
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:02,385
Yeah,
that would be painful.

1563
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,842
Man, have a beer, man.
That was awesome. Here.

1564
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,142
It's beer 30, children.

1565
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,344
Nice.

1566
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,522
Uh, no, thanks.

1567
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,689
Come on, man.

1568
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,438
What are you?
A pussy?

1569
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,737
I just don't feel like
drinking a beer right now.

1570
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,482
Man, if you're too chickenshit
to even have a beer,

1571
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,738
I know for a fact that you
have never gotten any pussy.

1572
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,028
Like you guys have.

1573
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,112
Sure have.

1574
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,196
When?

1575
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,535
Last summer.

1576
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,833
- With who?
- It was awesome.

1577
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,582
Chase went down easy street
and fucked this whore Nancy.

1578
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:33,662
At least,
that's what he said.

1579
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,123
I did. Would I lie?

1580
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:36,798
Bullshit. Quick,
where were you?

1581
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,091
At Taber's house.

1582
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,295
And she fucked
a couple other guys, too.

1583
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,051
Oh, man, his first piece
of ass was sloppy seconds.

1584
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,096
What about you, Mason?
You ever got any?

1585
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,645
Yeah, you ever made her, uh,
howl into the night?

1586
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,602
A few times.
Really'?

1587
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,685
Yeah, right, what was her name?
Lucky?

1588
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,985
No. Jennifer.

1589
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,782
She doesn't live here, though.
She's back in Houston.

1590
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,450
You're fucking lying.

1591
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,402
I don't care if you assholes
believe me or not.

1592
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,363
Let me guess, you were pulling
all kinds of ass back home,

1593
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:10,290
but once you got
down here, lefty.

1594
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,583
Hey, fuck you.

1595
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,456
I would, but none of
the girls here want to.

1596
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,288
Dude, it's not what they want,
man, it's what you want.

1597
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:17,915
True dat.

1598
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,046
You know what you
should do, join a band.

1599
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,627
That's all it takes, man.

1600
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,758
Oh, yeah?
Fuck, yeah, dude.

1601
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,589
You don't even have
to play that well.

1602
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,049
You start playing
your instrument,

1603
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,226
and they line up
to give you blowjobs.

1604
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,393
Except for you.

1605
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:31,595
It doesn't impress
the ladies so much

1606
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:33,351
when you play flute
for the marching band.

1607
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,270
I'm not in the
fucking marching band.

1608
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,443
Oh, dude, you sure? I heard
you play the skin flute.

1609
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,411
All right, I got
a question for you guys.

1610
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:41,898
If you think
you're so cool,

1611
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,779
why you hanging out with a bunch
of 8th graders on a Friday night?

1612
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,576
Hey. Fuck you,
you little penis wrinkle.

1613
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:47,949
You're lucky
to even be here.

1614
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,405
This is our camp-out.

1615
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,115
The only reason you little
cum gums are here

1616
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:52,950
is because fucking
Charlie's mom made him

1617
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,751
bring his little
asshole brother

1618
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:57,080
and then he drags along
you little dice danglers.

1619
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,506
Fucking fuzz nut,
talking shit!

1620
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,924
It's all good, man.

1621
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,718
These little fuzz nuts are going
to get their chance soon enough.

1622
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,341
We got some whores
coming by later.

1623
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,047
- Yeah?
- Hell yeah!

1624
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,642
Now, I know Chase
will fuck anything.

1625
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,139
I mean, I've seen this kid
mount boulders before.

1626
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,517
But what about you guys?
You in?

1627
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,477
- Whatever.
- All right.

1628
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:17,604
Good man.
All right.

1629
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,185
What about you, Peter Puffer?

1630
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,521
I don't know. Maybe.

1631
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,822
Dude, it's okay to be gay.
We understand.

1632
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,774
Just, you know,
sleep over there.

1633
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,820
I'm not gay-

1634
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,654
Give it some time, man.
You'll realize.

1635
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,076
Fuck y'all.

1636
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,408
See, that's exactly
my point, man.

1637
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,953
Nah, but we don't have
whores coming over.

1638
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,075
We were just fucking with
you to see what you'd say.

1639
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,169
And you just earned
your vag badge.

1640
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,008
Put it next
to your bitch card.

1641
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,603
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
you're a bitch.

1642
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,505
Now hold this like
the bitch you are, bitch.

1643
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,600
All right, this shit is
called the death punch.

1644
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,475
Whoa, Jesus!

1645
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,106
<i>Hey-</i>

1646
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,899
You guys made it! Good.

1647
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:08,442
Oh.

1648
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,285
There you are.
Oh, wow.

1649
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,534
And here you go, hostess.

1650
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,249
Oh, thank you.
Can I get you a bite?

1651
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,168
Oh, that's cool.
Thanks.

1652
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,586
You did that?

1653
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,958
Yeah.
Wow.

1654
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:23,499
How long have you
been doing that for?

1655
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,505
Not very long. Um...

1656
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,635
I went to this camp thing
just this past summer.

1657
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,009
They have a camp
for graffiti'?

1658
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:32,090
Well, they call it
"urban art." Oh.

1659
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,185
So it sounds, you know,
less illegal,

1660
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,638
but it was really just a way
to get free spray paint.

1661
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,478
Cool. So is this your tag?

1662
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,605
Is that...
Do they still call it...

1663
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:45,612
Yeah, but you know, it's just
letters that I'm good at writing.

1664
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:48,069
It's a "K..."

1665
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,026
E.

1666
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,827
"E-Z-J-O."

1667
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:55,656
Kez Jo.
That's cool.

1668
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,707
It doesn't really
mean anything, though.

1669
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:01,787
Is that your dad?

1670
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,254
Yeah.

1671
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,456
Where's he live?

1672
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,541
In Houston.

1673
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,463
Get to see him much?

1674
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,345
Yeah. Some weekends
and over the summer.

1675
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,546
Cool.

1676
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,553
So, you're a student
of my mom's, right?

1677
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:14,721
Mmm-hmm.

1678
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,644
Yeah,
I got one class with her.

1679
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,096
Yeah, she's cool.

1680
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,517
How's she doing? You know, is she
a good teacher and everything?

1681
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:23,816
Yeah, she's great!

1682
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:27,317
She's super-smart
and she cares, you know.

1683
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,739
She makes it interesting.

1684
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:31,658
She's probably even
my favorite teacher.

1685
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,912
So, anyway, we figured
out a way to rig up our iPods

1686
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:37,911
to the external speakers
on the ASB.

1687
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,492
So every time
we come rolling into town,

1688
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,293
you knew
the 4-56 was there

1689
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,808
'cause we were bumping
House of Pain.

1690
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,956
It was like,
"Jump around, jump around."

1691
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:46,164
And the whole family's
coming outside,

1692
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,751
you got the kids and,
uh, the mom and the dad

1693
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,427
and they're all
bouncing up and down,

1694
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,925
we're throwing out
candies for the kids

1695
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:56,555
and soccer balls and Beanie
Babies and Frisbees, uh,

1696
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:57,725
smokes for the adults,

1697
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:01,522
and, uh, they loved, they
absolutely loved Gatorade.

1698
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:04,692
But for some reason, you know,
they hated the lemon-lime flavor.

1699
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,314
I don't know what it was.

1700
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,270
Yeah.
Couldn't give it away.

1701
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,479
How long were you
over there?

1702
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:13,572
Uh, I did two tours in Iraq
and one in Bosnia.

1703
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,739
Wow.

1704
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,157
Did you enlist?

1705
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:20,912
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I was, um,
Army National Guard,

1706
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,664
and, you know, coming
straight out of high school,

1707
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,165
needed money
for college.

1708
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,484
Seemed like
a decent paying job.

1709
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:26,834
And, uh, did my tour.

1710
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,457
And whenever I got done
I told them,

1711
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,384
if there's a world-changing
event, I'll come back.

1712
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:36,216
And, uh, three months later 9/11
happened, and I was back 9/12.

1713
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:40,386
And I'm proud to say the 4-56,
the whole time we were there,

1714
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,938
we never lost a guy,
not one casualty.

1715
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,731
But is that odd?
Is that unusual?

1716
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,809
Yeah. Uh...

1717
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,735
Almost impossible.

1718
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:52,106
Like, the guys that came along
after us and replaced us,

1719
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:54,317
they didn't listen
to any of our advice.

1720
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,993
They did, basically, the polar
opposite of what we did,

1721
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,492
and they lost seven guys
in the first month.

1722
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:00,739
Wow.

1723
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:03,747
What did you guys
do differently?

1724
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:08,255
I like to think it's just a matter
of mutual respect, you know.

1725
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:11,174
All the time we spent over
there building trust,

1726
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,843
these guys basically
destroyed it in three days.

1727
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:16,297
So, what did the locals think
about why we're there?

1728
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,051
- Oil, plain and simple.
- Mmm.

1729
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:13,529
Hey, Mason.
One last hit.

1730
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:22,654
<i>Hey-</i>

1731
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,617
Mickey Mouse Club.
Get the fuck out of my car.

1732
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:28,543
Just crawl out the back
window or something, man.

1733
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,594
I'm gonna miss you.

1734
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,342
I'll see you
on Sunday night.

1735
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,890
All right. You better text me.

1736
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,431
Mmm...

1737
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,512
Do you have any gum?
Urn...

1738
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:50,565
Yeah, I do, actually.
Here you go.

1739
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,434
Thanks. See ya.

1740
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,238
And they're buying this party line
that they're supposed to feel bad

1741
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:58,611
and trade off
their own pension,

1742
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,283
<i>as</i> if that's what's been
corrupting this nation.

1743
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,110
Yeah, because
those who heart Fox,

1744
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:03,867
in my opinion,
are being lied to.

1745
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,618
Yeah,
thank God for Wisconsin.

1746
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,290
We have to follow
that example.

1747
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,787
You're right.

1748
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:13,751
Hey, Mason,
what time is it?

1749
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,295
Uh, like 12:15.

1750
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,381
Happy birthday

1751
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,005
Happy birthday!

1752
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,756
Mason.

1753
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,807
It's your birthday?

1754
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,305
Just now, I guess.

1755
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,761
Yeah, how old are you?

1756
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,312
Fifteen.

1757
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,765
Fifteen. Give me a hug.

1758
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,692
Happy birthday.
Oh, my goodness!

1759
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:39,364
Have you been drinking?

1760
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,612
Have you?

1761
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:44,236
Yeah, a little.
Have you?

1762
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:46,580
A little bit.

1763
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,699
Have you been...

1764
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,326
A little bit.

1765
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,204
Oh.

1766
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:54,496
Oh...

1767
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:56,339
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1768
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,044
Talk in the morning, huh?

1769
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:03,380
Hey, Dad.

1770
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:05,849
Hey! How you doing? Mmm... Good.

1771
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,093
Whose car is that?
That's our car.

1772
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,304
Hop on in there.
Hey.

1773
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:11,980
Hi, sweetie.

1774
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:13,723
Oh...

1775
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:15,642
Hey, Cooper.

1776
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:17,898
Hey! How's it going?

1777
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,904
Hello, little brother.

1778
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:21,610
He's so cute.

1779
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,658
Can we just replace
that part of the pipe?

1780
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:26,452
No, is no good.
Everything is no good.

1781
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,030
Everything. Yes, mira.

1782
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:34,870
This one is...

1783
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,170
Stronger.

1784
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,793
Yes. This is better,
yes, yes, yes.

1785
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,834
Hey, listen, thanks for
that camera you got Mason.

1786
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:44,255
Oh, yeah, Mason's all into the photography.
He's loving that thing.

1787
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:45,384
Yeah, I know.

1788
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:48,558
He's actually talking about turning
his, uh, closet into a darkroom.

1789
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,977
Like the red light and the
developing, the whole nine...

1790
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,144
You all right with that?

1791
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,348
I probably won't see him for a week.
Oh, yeah. Right.

1792
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:55,940
But he's having
a good time.

1793
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,401
At least he's focused on something.
Yeah. Yeah.

1794
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,196
That's what I like.
Yeah, he's all about it.

1795
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:02,485
Okay, let's go grande.

1796
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,654
It's good? It's better, yes.
It's good.

1797
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:13,332
You know, you're smart.
You should be in school.

1798
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,287
Oh, I like
school, I need school,

1799
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:19,540
but it's hard,
I working all day.

1800
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:23,673
Go to night school at community college.
It's pretty affordable.

1801
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:26,054
You're doing a nice job with the house.
It's looking great.

1802
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,221
Oh, thanks.
Really great.

1803
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:29,720
Yeah, you know, some
fix-its here and there.

1804
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:32,769
We got a good deal on a foreclosure,
so now I'm finding out why.

1805
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,097
Yeah, really. Hey, bud! Hey.

1806
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,103
Happy birthday, huh?
What's that?

1807
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:40,311
What's that? That's our new car.
Get in it.

1808
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,612
All right.
Have a good weekend.

1809
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,281
How you doing?

1810
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:47,446
Good to see you.
You, too.

1811
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,868
Hey!

1812
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:50,703
Hey, how are you?

1813
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:51,780
Ooh...

1814
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:54,082
You look great. Ooh!
Thanks.

1815
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:57,453
Look at him!
Aw, he's got Mason's nose.

1816
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:59,003
- Yeah, isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

1817
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:01,798
- All right!
- Love you guys.

1818
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:03,125
We got a big drive ahead of us.

1819
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,547
Bye, Sam.

1820
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:05,946
You guys drive safe.

1821
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:09,181
All right. Well,
we'll be back tomorrow night.

1822
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,724
Bye, honey.
I'm so glad you were born!

1823
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:31,199
So, this is like Annie's car
and you drive the GTO'?

1824
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:34,188
I guess you can't really put
a baby seat in that thing.

1825
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:37,243
Yeah, no. But I had
to sell that anyway.

1826
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:39,418
You what?

1827
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,292
Yeah, I had to sell that.

1828
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:44,169
So it's gone?

1829
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:46,593
Yeah, some sucker
collector from California

1830
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,511
paid <i>22</i> grand for it,
which is great

1831
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:51,055
'cause I basically got
to pay for this in cash.

1832
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,680
I only paid $8,500 for
that thing way back when.

1833
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:57,099
Cars are generally a terrible
investment, you know.

1834
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,350
Soon as you drive
them off the lot,

1835
01:31:58,430 --> 01:31:59,477
you got a used car
on your hands,

1836
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:01,433
and the value's only
dropping from there.

1837
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:05,191
But if you take care
of it, you know,

1838
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,817
and you get lucky
and it's a classic,

1839
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:08,364
the value starts
going up again.

1840
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,114
Shit, you got guys paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars

1841
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,115
for some Shelby Cobra.

1842
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:19,200
What?

1843
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,623
You don't remember?

1844
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,549
Remember what?
Really?

1845
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:31,383
You said that was going to
be my car when I turned 16.

1846
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:35,434
What? No,
I didn't. I never said that.

1847
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:37,385
I remember.
I was in third grade

1848
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,973
and you were taking me over to Anthony
Nadar's house for his birthday,

1849
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:43,605
and we were there early, so we
gave him a ride around the block,

1850
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:45,401
and he was talking about how
much he loved your car,

1851
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,397
and so you were all like, "Oh, this is
gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."

1852
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,533
All right, first off, I have
no memory of that, all right?

1853
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:55,112
Second of all, I would
never say that. Never.

1854
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:57,075
Oh, you did, though.

1855
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,372
What?

1856
01:32:58,656 --> 01:32:59,828
Mason.

1857
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:02,626
Come on,
what about your sister?

1858
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:03,942
I'm just gonna
forget about her?

1859
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,123
Come on,
how's that fair? Huh?

1860
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,508
Anthony Nagar. What...

1861
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,836
Are you...

1862
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:12,341
Oh, come on!

1863
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,844
I mean, you're not...

1864
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,647
Look, you can sit there like there's
a death in the family, all right,

1865
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:24,565
but bottom line is, that was my car.
All right?

1866
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,860
I paid for it,
I took care of it,

1867
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:29,654
and I can do whatever
I want with it. All right?

1868
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:32,232
I'm sorry if you had other ideas
about it, but when you get older,

1869
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:34,363
you can save up
and buy a car of your own.

1870
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,661
Be cool like I used to be.

1871
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:40,165
Or you can get a minivan.

1872
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,973
Does your mom actually
let you watch this'?

1873
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,142
Yeah. She likes it, too.

1874
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,228
Oh, my God.

1875
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:12,693
Okay, well, have you ever
seen her in concert?

1876
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,158
No, but she's coming
to Houston in April.

1877
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,951
She's coming to Houston?
Mmm-hmm.

1878
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:20,155
Your dad and I could get you tickets
and you could stay with us.

1879
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,081
That'd be great!
Yeah.

1880
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,730
- Hey, Annie?
- Yup.

1881
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,668
Will you get me the little
birthday present for Mason?

1882
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:30,839
Here, babe.
All right.

1883
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:34,636
This one needs
a little explanation, okay?

1884
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,551
Open it up.

1885
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:40,554
I call that
the Beatles Black Album.

1886
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:44,388
What it is, is the best of
John, Paul, George and Ringo,

1887
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,472
solo, post-breakup.

1888
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:48,558
Thanks.

1889
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,521
Basically, I put the band back
together for you.

1890
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,358
Whenever you listen
to too much of the solo stuff,

1891
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:53,984
it kind of becomes a drag,
you know?

1892
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:57,408
But you put them next
to each other, right,

1893
01:34:57,483 --> 01:34:59,076
and they start
to elevate each other,

1894
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,495
and then you can hear it.

1895
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,242
It's The Beatles,
you know?

1896
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:05,834
I don't know. I think I always
just liked Paul the best.

1897
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,585
It doesn't matter, you know,
you're missing the point.

1898
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,708
There is no favorite Beatle!

1899
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:11,835
That's what I'm saying.
It's in the balance.

1900
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:14,043
That's what made them
the greatest fucking rock band

1901
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,298
in the world, okay?

1902
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,379
And there's this decade
of music out there

1903
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:19,885
that's been scattered,
all right,

1904
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:24,140
and now it has been carefully
found, arranged and ordered for you

1905
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:25,721
by your loving father.

1906
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:27,601
Very arranged
and very organized,

1907
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,024
over and over again
by your loving father.

1908
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,396
Yes, yes, yes.

1909
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,228
So, I mean,
look at that, look at that.

1910
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,484
Uh, top of Volume ll,
first four tracks,

1911
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,816
<i>you've got Band on the Run
into My Sweet Lord</i>

1912
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:40,823
<i>into Jealous Guy
into Photograph. Come on!</i>

1913
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:42,529
It's like the perfect segue.

1914
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,910
You got Paul,
who takes you to the party,

1915
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,912
George who talks
to you about God,

1916
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:50,291
John is just, "No,
it's about love and pain,"

1917
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,372
and then Ringo
who just says,

1918
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:55,254
"Hey. Can't we enjoy what
we have while we have it?"

1919
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,552
It's a good record.
I shit you not.

1920
01:35:58,253 --> 01:35:59,254
Cool.

1921
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:28,161
Hey, there, Cliff.
Hey, how you doing?

1922
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:29,721
Good. How you doing?
Hi, birthday boy!

1923
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:30,952
It's good to see you.

1924
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,878
Ah, it's great to see you. Yeah.

1925
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:34,460
You made it
all right, huh?

1926
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:35,739
Yeah, we sure did.
We sure did.

1927
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:36,840
How are you, darling?

1928
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:38,968
Let's just get this one...
All right, we ready?

1929
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:40,090
Yeah.

1930
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:41,303
Wait.

1931
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,886
Hey, Sam.

1932
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:45,808
Wait, wait, wait.
Come on.

1933
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:47,473
Hey, still sleeping here?

1934
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:48,678
Oh, yeah.

1935
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,013
Hey, buddy.

1936
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:51,389
Oh!

1937
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:15,538
Make a wish,
make a wish.

1938
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:22,629
Real good! Presents! Wait, wait, wait.
Here, sweetie.

1939
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,792
Sam, would you get us
a knife so we can cut this up'?

1940
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,181
All right.

1941
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:30,266
I hope you like it. I
heard you didn't have one, so.

1942
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:32,684
It's a Bible. This is your first Bible.

1943
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:35,183
Look,
there's your name.

1944
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,852
Wow. In gold. And
wait, wait, wait.

1945
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:38,481
Look at this.

1946
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:39,687
It's a red-letter edition,

1947
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:42,900
and that means that everything
that Jesus said is in red.

1948
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,492
Thank you. You like it?
All right.

1949
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,366
I love you, sweetie.
Happy birthday.

1950
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:48,825
And this
one's from us.

1951
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:50,578
Oh, yeah, here.

1952
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:53,785
It's not going to make all
your dreams come true here.

1953
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:55,290
Just keep
your expectations low.

1954
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:56,496
No, you need it.
It's...

1955
01:37:57,705 --> 01:38:00,675
Come on, right? You gotta have it.
You need this.

1956
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,218
You got life ahead of you.

1957
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,715
And the shirt is blue.

1958
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,889
You got dances
and job interviews.

1959
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:07,683
Here, I'm going to get
it all wrinkled here.

1960
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,054
Mason? Come here, son.
Uh-oh.

1961
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,312
Pull that Off.

1962
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:25,199
There's a 20-gauge shotgun.
Wow.

1963
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,408
My dad gave it to me when I was
a little younger than you,

1964
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,615
and his dad gave it to him.

1965
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:36,498
Well, you're 15 and I'd like
for you to have it, all right?

1966
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,871
Here, you hold it.

1967
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:40,916
Yeah?

1968
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:42,584
Thank you.
Congratulations, son.

1969
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,169
I'll teach you
how to clean it,

1970
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,095
teach you how to fire it.

1971
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,633
I'll teach
you a little bit of safety.

1972
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:52,093
Now cock it.
All right, there you go.

1973
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,599
Now, what you want to do is line up
the front sight with the back sight.

1974
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:56,101
Here, you see this little V right here?
Mmm-hmm.

1975
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,272
Now which one
you aiming at?

1976
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,349
Uh, the middle can.

1977
01:38:58,433 --> 01:38:59,901
The middle can? All right.
Mmm-hmm.

1978
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,195
Now fire at will,
all right?

1979
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,823
Ho! Whoa!
Yeah!

1980
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,736
All right, watch out, watch out.
Whoa. Be careful. All right.

1981
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:11,362
Ready?

1982
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,369
Pull!

1983
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,377
Oh, you hit a little low.

1984
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,246
Wait till it gets up high,
then shoot, all right?

1985
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:23,299
'Cause then it's a better
aim coming down.

1986
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:26,711
Remember, second trigger.

1987
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:27,795
Mmm-hmm.

1988
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,474
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.

1989
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:34,181
Pull!

1990
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:40,100
Look what you did! Well,
you nailed it, didn't you?

1991
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:42,940
How did that feel?
Felt good.

1992
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:44,612
Yeah, it felt good. Good.

1993
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:47,903
<i>Well, I want for
us to be together forever</i>

1994
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:51,077
<i>But to wander
wherever I may</i>

1995
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,996
<i>I want you to be
easy and casual</i>

1996
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:57,541
<i>But still demand I stay</i>

1997
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:00,291
<i>I want for you
to know me completely</i>

1998
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,379
<i>But still remain
mysterious</i>

1999
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:05,170
<i>Consider
everything deeply</i>

2000
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:07,718
<i>But still remain fearless</i>

2001
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:11,722
<i>Climb to the top
Look over the ledge</i>

2002
01:40:11,797 --> 01:40:14,926
<i>Dance barefoot
on a razor's edge</i>

2003
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,933
<i>Reach for the stars
Grab a tiger by the tail</i>

2004
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:21,186
<i>If I don't try,
I'll never fail</i>

2005
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,984
If you go
home You're rolling the dice

2006
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,734
<i>Can't step
in the same river twice</i>

2007
01:40:26,812 --> 01:40:29,907
<i>You love too much
It'll turn to hate</i>

2008
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,861
<i>You never leave home
You'll never be late</i>

2009
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:36,289
<i>You eat too much
You're gonna get fat</i>

2010
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:38,958
<i>If you buy a dog
You'll piss off your cat</i>

2011
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:42,037
<i>So take a deep breath
and enjoy the ride</i>

2012
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:48,422
<i>'Cause arrivals and departures
Run side by side</i>

2013
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:50,294
Oh!

2014
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:53,135
You're our first
audience, you know?

2015
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:56,059
Mason demanded we work
on it the whole time.

2016
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:57,385
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

2017
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:58,970
It's a work in progress.

2018
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:00,562
A week later,
we don't know why

2019
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,857
Thomas wasn't there
the first time, uh,

2020
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:06,903
but a week later,
Thomas comes back

2021
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:08,400
and joins
the other disciples.

2022
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:10,607
They say, "The Lord's
alive, we saw him!"

2023
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:14,411
"I won't believe it until I
put my finger into his side,

2024
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:17,409
"and I wanna see those
nail prints in his hands."

2025
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,488
About
that time, here comes Jesus

2026
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:21,830
standing right
next to him, okay?

2027
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:25,459
And he turns to Thomas. Don't you
know, Thomas felt some shame.

2028
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,665
He turns to Thomas
and says,

2029
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:30,467
"Thomas, here, stick
your finger in my side.

2030
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,466
"Look at these nail prints.
It's me."

2031
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:37,012
And Thomas <i>says,</i> "My Lord
and my God, I believe."

2032
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:40,019
And Jesus said,
"Well, that's good,

2033
01:41:40,553 --> 01:41:44,808
"but blessed are those who
can believe without seeing."

2034
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:49,938
It's a lot easier when you
can see and feel and touch,

2035
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:53,400
but like us, we haven't
seen him in the flesh,

2036
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,360
we haven't felt him
in the flesh,

2037
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:57,787
but we have experienced
him in the spirit.

2038
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:00,365
At least, I have,
and I hope y'all have, too.

2039
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:04,201
The pond's right up here.

2040
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:08,831
Ooh, it's low.

2041
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:10,211
Yeah.

2042
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,294
You know, my dad could
take you fishing

2043
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:13,593
next time you're here
if you want.

2044
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:14,886
Thanks.

2045
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:20,722
Hi, baby.
What's goin' on?

2046
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:23,854
No, I think we're just gonna
hang here for a minute.

2047
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:25,351
You want me
to stay with you?

2048
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:26,808
No, it's okay.
You sure?

2049
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:27,892
Yeah. Thanks.

2050
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,613
Mason, why are you
such a stick-in-the-mud?

2051
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:39,153
What are you
even talking about?

2052
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:40,988
You guys don't mind coming
back here on the 20th, do you,

2053
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:42,164
for Cooper's baptism?

2054
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,367
No, that's fine.
Sam?

2055
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:45,952
I appreciate it.

2056
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:48,879
It means a lot to Annie
and her folks, you know.

2057
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,458
Were we baptized?

2058
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:59,382
I wasn't the least bit concerned
with the state of your soul.

2059
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,346
We can do it now,
though, if you want.

2060
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:02,472
No, I think
I'm all right.

2061
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:04,428
You and Cooper together,
you know.

2062
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:06,105
Dunk your heads.

2063
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:09,225
You're not becoming one of those
God people, are you, Dad?

2064
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:11,060
And what's that
supposed to mean, huh?

2065
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:13,020
I can hear you!

2066
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:14,985
Oh, wow.

2067
01:43:15,064 --> 01:43:17,317
I think that shotgun should
live at my house, huh?

2068
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,694
I don't think your mom would love that.

2069
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:23,413
Look out, Sam.

2070
01:43:23,489 --> 01:43:25,412
Let me show you
how it's done.

2071
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,626
Nice, Dad.

2072
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:32,665
Still got the goods, hmm?

2073
01:43:46,429 --> 01:43:48,898
How long you been
in here, Mason?

2074
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,065
I'm not sure.

2075
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:51,939
I'm sure.

2076
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:53,519
All class.

2077
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:55,692
Did you complete
your image diary?

2078
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:56,985
Not yet.

2079
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:00,071
Completed your, uh,
digital contact sheet?

2080
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:03,075
Not quite, but it's
not gonna take me long.

2081
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:05,824
Not yet. Not quite.

2082
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:09,452
Dark room time
is extra-curricular.

2083
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:13,081
I mean, technically, you don't ever
have to be in here these days,

2084
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:15,667
and certainly not until you've
completed your assignments.

2085
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:16,797
That's the deal.

2086
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:18,343
Sorry.

2087
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:20,429
I'm worried about
you, Mason.

2088
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:22,093
Why is that?

2089
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:23,299
I'll tell you why.

2090
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:26,849
The images you're turning
in, they're cool.

2091
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:30,394
You're looking at things
in a really unique way.

2092
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,191
Got a lot of natural talent.

2093
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:34,067
Thanks.

2094
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:36,111
Yeah, but that
and 50 cents

2095
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:39,031
will just get you a cup of
coffee in this old world.

2096
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:42,868
I've met a lot of talented
people over the years.

2097
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:47,870
How many of them
made it professionally

2098
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:50,201
without discipline,
commitment

2099
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,537
and a really good
work ethic?

2100
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:56,670
I can tell you. I can
count it on two fingers.

2101
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:58,630
Zero.

2102
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:00,886
It's not gonna happen
for you, Mason.

2103
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:02,679
The world is too competitive.

2104
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:06,134
There are too many talented people
who are willing to work hard,

2105
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:09,141
and a butt load of morons
who are untalented

2106
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,097
who are more than
willing to surpass you.

2107
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,182
As a matter of fact, a lot of them
are sitting in that classroom

2108
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:14,642
out there right now, hmm?

2109
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:15,845
You know what they're doing?

2110
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:17,444
They're doing
their assignments.

2111
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,488
Which is what you're supposed
to be doing, but you're not.

2112
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:20,689
You're in here.

2113
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:22,070
Now why is that?

2114
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:24,239
You special, Mason?

2115
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,366
No, but the things
you're talking about,

2116
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:28,197
like work ethic
or whatever,

2117
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,907
I feel like I do
work pretty hard.

2118
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,962
I spend the whole weekend
taking pictures a lot of times.

2119
01:45:36,789 --> 01:45:38,962
You like football, Mason?

2120
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:41,385
Not really.

2121
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,507
Yeah, I know you don't.

2122
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:44,588
That's why
I've just assigned you

2123
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:47,676
to shoot the football
game tonight. Okay?

2124
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:49,931
It starts at 7:30, I want
you to get there early,

2125
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:53,014
I want you to shoot a full card, 300
images, I want them downloaded,

2126
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:56,601
I want them sorted, and I want to
see them very first thing Monday.

2127
01:45:58,018 --> 01:45:59,520
You want to know
why I'm doing this?

2128
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:01,818
I guess.

2129
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,615
Who do you want
to be, Mason'?

2130
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:05,526
What do you want to do?

2131
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:08,533
I want to take pictures.
Make art.

2132
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:11,449
Any dipshit can
take pictures, Mason.

2133
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:14,751
Art, that's special.

2134
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,338
What can you bring to it
that nobody else can?

2135
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,417
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

2136
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:23,590
Try harder.

2137
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:27,549
Maybe in 20 years you can call old Mr.
Turlington and you can say,

2138
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:29,383
"Thank you, sir,

2139
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:32,265
"for that terrific darkroom
chat we had that day."

2140
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:37,274
Get back to class
and do your work.

2141
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,699
Hey, man, you're walkin'
a little funny.

2142
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:54,408
Fuck you.

2143
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:58,496
I'm just saying, you guys were
in there for a long time.

2144
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:02,004
Just hope he bought
you dinner first.

2145
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,354
Mason! Honey,
come down for dinner.

2146
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:25,489
Samantha! You didn't post these
pictures and their descriptions?

2147
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:27,737
Come on. This auction is
gonna end on Sunday, honey.

2148
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:29,784
You've gotta get
those posted.

2149
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:31,703
Why are we even doing this?

2150
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,577
It's like an online
junk shop.

2151
01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:34,873
I thought you had
a good job.

2152
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:37,418
I do. We're what
you call house poor.

2153
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:39,442
Everyone's got
to do their part.

2154
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:40,653
Your brother took
the pictures.

2155
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,582
You have to help.

2156
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:43,962
Who even buys this shit?

2157
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:46,464
Hey. Sam, watch your mouth,
all right?

2158
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:48,136
Don't disrespect
your mother.

2159
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:49,852
You like a roof over
your head, don't you?

2160
01:47:50,089 --> 01:47:51,591
Yeah, and you like
having electricity

2161
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:53,234
so that you can charge
your cell phone'?

2162
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:56,645
I'm not even gonna
be here next year.

2163
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:59,728
I'm a senior.
I should be having fun.

2164
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:20,418
Nice nails.

2165
01:48:21,537 --> 01:48:24,256
Yeah, some girl did
that in sixth period.

2166
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,797
You planning
on keeping them?

2167
01:48:27,876 --> 01:48:30,049
Until it comes off,
I guess.

2168
01:48:32,297 --> 01:48:36,222
Last summer it was the
earrings, and now the nails.

2169
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:39,225
You got a purse
to go with all that?

2170
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:42,604
A lot of guys do that.
He's just trying to be cool.

2171
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:48,989
When I was in high school,
having a job,

2172
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:53,778
being responsible, being able
to afford a car, that was cool.

2173
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:55,783
Mason, honey,

2174
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:58,616
why don't you get you and
your sister some water.

2175
01:49:31,023 --> 01:49:34,903
Hey, man, Turlington says to cut
the artsy crap and shoot the game.

2176
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:37,238
So take your lens
and point it that way.

2177
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:38,322
Jesus Christ.

2178
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:40,624
Also, we got a ride.

2179
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:42,121
McCormick's gonna
take us to the party.

2180
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:43,919
We're gonna head out
after the game.

2181
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:45,086
You're goin', okay?

2182
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:46,163
Okay.

2183
01:49:46,246 --> 01:49:47,873
Shoot the game.

2184
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:24,915
First one! What was that?
What was that? What is up?

2185
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,808
Hey, what's up?
Hey.

2186
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,058
How's it goin'?

2187
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:45,435
Pretty good.

2188
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:47,016
How long have
you been here?

2189
01:50:47,516 --> 01:50:48,984
I don't know.
A while, I guess.

2190
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:50,356
Awhile?

2191
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:57,485
I just feel like there are so
many things that I could be doing

2192
01:50:57,568 --> 01:51:00,321
and probably want to be
doing that I'm just not.

2193
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:01,451
Why aren't you?

2194
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:06,502
I mean, I guess it's just being
afraid of what people would think.

2195
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,375
You know, judgment.
Yeah.

2196
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,463
I guess it's really easy
to say like,

2197
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:12,086
"I don't care
what anyone else thinks,"

2198
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:14,335
but everyone does, you know?
Exactly.

2199
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:15,761
Deep down.

2200
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:19,845
I find myself so furious at all these
people that I'm in contact with

2201
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:22,517
just for controlling me
or whatever,

2202
01:51:22,593 --> 01:51:25,767
but, you know, they're not
even aware they're doing it.

2203
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,602
Yeah.

2204
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:33,066
So, in this perfect world, where
no one's controlling you,

2205
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:35,568
what's different?
What changes?

2206
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:37,570
Everything.

2207
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:40,744
I mean, I just wanna be
able to do anything I want,

2208
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:42,287
because it makes me
feel alive.

2209
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:46,413
As opposed to giving me
the appearance of normality.

2210
01:51:46,992 --> 01:51:48,835
Whatever that means.

2211
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:52,089
I don't think
it means much.

2212
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:56,301
You're kinda weird, you know that?

2213
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:57,799
Yeah?

2214
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,052
Is that a compliment?

2215
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:04,101
I don't know.
Do you wanna be weird?

2216
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,856
I mean, I don't want to like scare kids
at the park, or anything like that.

2217
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:12,143
I really like
talking with you.

2218
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:15,900
I don't usually even try
to vocalize my thoughts

2219
01:52:15,979 --> 01:52:17,356
or feelings
or anything.

2220
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:21,364
I don't know, it never sounds right.
Words are stupid.

2221
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:25,622
So, why are you
trying with me?

2222
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,326
I don't know.
I guess I feel comfortable.

2223
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:31,203
I'm glad.

2224
01:52:35,332 --> 01:52:37,084
Hey, Jim.

2225
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:38,384
I'm sorry I'm so late.

2226
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:41,589
What time are you
supposed to be home?

2227
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:44,850
I don't know.
A while ago.

2228
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:49,514
While ago like, 30 minutes
ago, an hour ago?

2229
01:52:50,472 --> 01:52:52,474
'Cause truthfully
nobody even knew

2230
01:52:52,557 --> 01:52:54,157
where you were
until your sister told us.

2231
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,944
She's been home
for a while.

2232
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:58,530
I'm sorry.

2233
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:01,951
Yeah, been hearin'
a lot of that lately.

2234
01:53:03,318 --> 01:53:06,242
See, but you
don't actually care.

2235
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:10,167
You just kinda come
and go <i>as</i> you please,

2236
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:12,752
and you don't care
if your mom's upset,

2237
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:15,126
or what time
you gotta be home.

2238
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:16,916
Is that what's up?

2239
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:19,243
I don't know
what to tell you.

2240
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:20,969
Stop mumbling!

2241
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:22,796
You know, speak up!

2242
01:53:23,297 --> 01:53:25,425
I can't understand a word
comin' out of your mouth.

2243
01:53:25,507 --> 01:53:27,475
It's just like...

2244
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:29,474
And I ask you questions
and you just...

2245
01:53:29,553 --> 01:53:32,147
Can I just have one day where
everyone isn't all over my ass?

2246
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:36,901
I'm up your ass?

2247
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:40,651
This is my house.
All right'?

2248
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:42,483
If you wanna live
in my house,

2249
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:44,864
then you get home when you
say you're gonna be home.

2250
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:46,445
You know, Jim,
you're not my dad.

2251
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:48,243
No, I'm not your dad.

2252
01:53:48,322 --> 01:53:51,451
You know how I know that?
'Cause I'm actually here.

2253
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:53,748
I'm the guy with the job,
payin' the bills,

2254
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:57,752
takin' care of you, your
mom, your sister, huh? Huh?

2255
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:00,550
I'm that guy!

2256
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:25,067
Morning.
Morning.

2257
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:30,206
Hey. Which one of you guys used the
downstairs bathroom last night?

2258
01:54:30,906 --> 01:54:33,125
I don't know.
I didn't.

2259
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:34,956
That tall guy,
what's his name?

2260
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:37,628
Phillip?

2261
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:41,208
Yeah, Phillip. He did it.
Can Phillip read?

2262
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:42,338
You know, there's
a big sign on the door.

2263
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:44,044
It says, "Do not use this
bathroom, it's broken."

2264
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:46,300
I mean,
how difficult is that?

2265
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:49,140
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

2266
01:54:54,346 --> 01:54:56,146
I think I'm gonna put the
house on the market.

2267
01:54:57,391 --> 01:54:58,688
Why?

2268
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:00,235
This house is too big for us.

2269
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,903
You're going to
school eventually.

2270
01:55:01,978 --> 01:55:03,980
It's too expensive.
I'm done.

2271
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,611
Why did you even buy it
in the first place then?

2272
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:11,238
Because I really enjoy
making poor life decisions,

2273
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:13,790
keeping us on
the brink of poverty.

2274
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:18,120
I've spent the first half of my
life acquiring all this crap,

2275
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:19,921
and now I'm gonna spend
the second half of my life

2276
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:21,589
getting rid
of all this stuff.

2277
01:55:21,665 --> 01:55:23,884
Really? Like what?

2278
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:26,650
Well, I got rid of
a couple husbands,

2279
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:28,070
now I'm gonna get rid
of a mortgage,

2280
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:31,388
some maintenance,
the tchotchskes,

2281
01:55:31,466 --> 01:55:35,221
the homeowner's insurance, the
property tax, the plumbing.

2282
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,483
You know what?
From now on,

2283
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:41,526
I am gonna be Mommy Monk.

2284
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:44,187
Simple. Celibate.

2285
01:55:44,396 --> 01:55:46,194
Don't be gross, Mom.

2286
01:55:48,567 --> 01:55:49,693
Fine.

2287
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:52,283
I'll be a poor whore
with a big house.

2288
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:54,785
Is that better? Hmm?

2289
01:55:55,574 --> 01:55:57,076
Okay.

2290
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:05,627
Mason, please, don't leave
me that dirty dish to wash.

2291
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:08,219
I do dishes all day.

2292
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,135
Oh, great! Honey,
then you're a professional.

2293
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:14,184
Come on, you could do one or two
more for your poor old mom.

2294
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:15,385
Okay.

2295
01:56:15,927 --> 01:56:17,850
Thank you.

2296
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:41,870
You want one?

2297
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:43,247
Oh, God!

2298
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:44,502
She didn't even
touch them, seriously.

2299
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:45,958
I watched her
the whole time.

2300
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:48,919
I bet you did watch her,
you little pervert.

2301
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:53,970
It's like
we're on a date.

2302
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:55,767
Cheers.

2303
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,433
It's a night of romance.

2304
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:01,106
Yeah, except
I'm not gonna kiss you.

2305
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:04,814
I will blow you, though.

2306
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:15,700
Mason! We are in
the weeds out here!

2307
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:17,122
I'm goin' <i>as</i> fast
<i>as</i> I can.

2308
01:57:17,364 --> 01:57:19,412
Oh, then I must be
confused then,

2309
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:21,243
'cause I just saw you
chattin' it up with April,

2310
01:57:21,326 --> 01:57:23,044
when I got a salad bar
that needs a refill,

2311
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:25,588
I got a six-top,
two four-tops I can't use

2312
01:57:25,664 --> 01:57:26,961
because they
haven't been bussed!

2313
01:57:27,249 --> 01:57:29,377
Enrique is not here.
I'm tryin'.

2314
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,216
Well, while you're tryin',
we're dyin'!

2315
01:57:32,295 --> 01:57:34,093
What am I supposed
to tell my customers?

2316
01:57:34,172 --> 01:57:37,051
"Oh, I'm sorry that your table's
got dirty plates on it,

2317
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:38,635
"but Mason's trying.

2318
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:40,770
"At least that's
what he told me.

2319
01:57:40,845 --> 01:57:43,644
"After he was flirtin' with April
and eatin' your leftover shrimp."

2320
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:46,897
Now it is a challenge
out there today, I know,

2321
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:49,521
but I wanna share
something with you.

2322
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,190
I got you pegged
for fry cook this summer,

2323
01:57:52,274 --> 01:57:54,117
and that's a lot
more responsibility.

2324
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:57,450
It's also more money.
How's that sound?

2325
01:57:58,488 --> 01:57:59,535
Good.

2326
01:58:00,365 --> 01:58:02,242
I know you can
handle that money,

2327
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:04,703
but can you take
the responsibility?

2328
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:07,664
I think you can,
because I believe in you.

2329
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:08,867
But I need you on the floor.

2330
01:58:09,165 --> 01:58:11,088
Now leave the dishes.
Giddy up.

2331
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:14,171
All right, come on!
Don't let me down!

2332
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:21,554
<i>Well, so it's runnin' okay? That
alternator's not messin' up anymore?</i>

2333
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:24,018
No, it's fine.
It's up for the trip.

2334
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:25,850
<i>Good.</i>

2335
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:29,444
<i>Are you gonna see your sister
when you guys are in Austin?</i>

2336
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:31,772
Yeah, she said I can stay
at her dorm, which is cool.

2337
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:34,215
And I guess her roommate's out
of town, so it's no big deal.

2338
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:36,655
<i>All right.
Did you apply there yet?</i>

2339
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,328
<i>Did you get that
application into UT?</i>

2340
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:41,156
Not yet, but Sheena's
pretty much in, though.

2341
01:58:41,239 --> 01:58:43,241
<i>Right. Well, if you know
that's where you wanna go,</i>

2342
01:58:43,325 --> 01:58:45,999
<i>you should probably do that early
acceptance thing, you know?</i>

2343
01:58:46,077 --> 01:58:48,546
<i>Seriously, let 'em know you're
a man who knows what he wants.</i>

2344
01:58:48,663 --> 01:58:49,663
Yeah.

2345
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:53,051
<i>A little bit of decisiveness goes a
long way in this life, all right?</i>

2346
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:54,548
<i>Yeah.
Great.</i>

2347
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:56,505
<i>And what about work?
How's that goin'?</i>

2348
01:58:57,672 --> 01:58:59,219
Uh, I don't know.
It's all right.

2349
01:58:59,299 --> 01:59:01,176
Today kind of sucked.
This guy didn't show up.

2350
01:59:02,218 --> 01:59:04,971
But it's definitely an interesting
perspective on the world.

2351
01:59:05,305 --> 01:59:06,898
People are slobs.

2352
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,944
<i>Well, when people ask me
about you, I say to them,</i>

2353
01:59:11,019 --> 01:59:12,316
<i>"Mason, he's doing great.</i>

2354
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:15,365
<i>"He's got a job,
he's really cleanin' up.”</i>

2355
01:59:16,191 --> 01:59:19,365
<i>All right, say hi to Annie
and Cooper, will you?</i>

2356
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:22,330
<i>Say hi to your big brother.
"Hey, big brother."</i>

2357
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:24,373
Hey, Annie.
Hey, kiddo.

2358
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:25,666
<i>Can you say bye-bye?</i>

2359
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,460
<i>Bye-bye!</i>

2360
01:59:27,911 --> 01:59:29,413
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

2361
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:32,566
<i>All right. Well, be careful
when you're driving, all right?</i>

2362
01:59:32,582 --> 01:59:36,052
<i>Don't be texting, don't be doing
any of that. All right, just...</i>

2363
01:59:36,127 --> 01:59:40,598
<i>You're Obi-Wan You're
centered, patient. Right?</i>

2364
01:59:40,674 --> 01:59:42,847
<i>You watch three cars ahead,
two behind.</i>

2365
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:45,349
<i>Takes two bad drivers
to have an accident, okay?</i>

2366
01:59:45,428 --> 01:59:46,429
Okay.

2367
01:59:46,638 --> 01:59:50,359
<i>Listen, tell your sister to pick up her
phone or call me back or something.</i>

2368
01:59:50,433 --> 01:59:51,901
<i>Okay.
All right, buddy.</i>

2369
01:59:51,976 --> 01:59:54,104
<i>You have a good one.
Bye, Dad.</i>

2370
01:59:56,523 --> 01:59:58,366
Hey, honey, take this
to your sister.

2371
01:59:58,441 --> 01:59:59,909
Throw it in the truck, okay?

2372
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:01,782
Okay, I will.

2373
02:00:02,445 --> 02:00:03,822
So where
is Sheena staying?

2374
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:05,327
At her friend Emily's.

2375
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,333
Is Emily a real person?

2376
02:00:07,409 --> 02:00:08,661
Yeah.

2377
02:00:08,743 --> 02:00:11,747
Yeah, she's a sophomore.
She has an apartment.

2378
02:00:14,124 --> 02:00:15,967
Okay, this is in case
of emergency.

2379
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:17,715
Don't spend it,
I want it back.

2380
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:19,637
Okay. Thanks.

2381
02:00:21,172 --> 02:00:22,389
Did you do
your homework?

2382
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:24,893
Most of it, but I can
finish tomorrow night.

2383
02:00:25,844 --> 02:00:28,518
Honey, 11th grade is really important
for college. Don't blow it.

2384
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:32,066
I know, I know. I mean, we're
going to UT and everything.

2385
02:00:32,142 --> 02:00:33,485
Oh, don't you want
me to come?

2386
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,609
"Come on, Sheena, road trip
with Mom!" I'll pay for gas.

2387
02:00:36,688 --> 02:00:37,814
Fine.

2388
02:00:38,565 --> 02:00:40,613
Just kidding. I have work.

2389
02:00:43,027 --> 02:00:44,324
Call me when
you get there.

2390
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:45,621
I will.

2391
02:00:47,615 --> 02:00:49,242
Have fun!

2392
02:00:57,792 --> 02:00:59,510
That sounds to
me like just another

2393
02:00:59,586 --> 02:01:01,964
extreme Mason
view of everything.

2394
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:04,474
Not at all!
I finally figured it out.

2395
02:01:04,549 --> 02:01:07,393
It's like when they realized
it was gonna be too expensive

2396
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:11,349
to actually build
cyborgs and robots.

2397
02:01:12,056 --> 02:01:13,603
I mean, the costs
of that were impossible.

2398
02:01:13,683 --> 02:01:15,435
They decided to
just let humans

2399
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:17,612
turn themselves
into robots.

2400
02:01:17,687 --> 02:01:19,280
That's what's
going on right now.

2401
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:20,481
Oh, right now?

2402
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:21,566
Yeah! I mean, why not?

2403
02:01:21,649 --> 02:01:26,029
They're billions of us just laying
around, not really doing anything.

2404
02:01:27,363 --> 02:01:28,740
We don't cost anything.

2405
02:01:28,823 --> 02:01:33,545
We're even pretty good at self-maintenance
and reproducing constantly.

2406
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:38,842
And as it turns out, we're
already biologically programmed

2407
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:40,715
for our little
cyborg upgrades.

2408
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:42,421
How?
Seriously.

2409
02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:44,973
I read this thing
the other day about how...

2410
02:01:45,048 --> 02:01:47,767
When you hear
that ding on your inbox,

2411
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:50,561
you get like a dopamine
rush in your brain.

2412
02:01:50,637 --> 02:01:52,310
It's like we're being
chemically rewarded

2413
02:01:52,388 --> 02:01:54,937
for allowing ourselves
to be brainwashed.

2414
02:01:55,433 --> 02:01:58,812
How evil is that?
We're fucked.

2415
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:01,990
So you deleting your Facebook
page is gonna change all that?

2416
02:02:03,399 --> 02:02:06,323
Remember when Trevor deleted
his Facebook page last year

2417
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:08,279
and everyone just hated him?

2418
02:02:08,363 --> 02:02:09,706
You made more fun
of him than anyone.

2419
02:02:09,781 --> 02:02:11,624
I still make fun
of Trevor though.

2420
02:02:13,243 --> 02:02:16,417
It was like he was so pathetically
desperate for attention.

2421
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:18,123
Or to be different,
or something.

2422
02:02:18,206 --> 02:02:21,585
That's just 'cause they did that lame
story about it in the school paper.

2423
02:02:21,918 --> 02:02:23,591
And then he had to make
a big announcement about it

2424
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:25,263
when he came back
a month later.

2425
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:27,432
That's the thing, though, I'm
not doing it for attention.

2426
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:30,852
I just wanna try and not live
my life through a screen.

2427
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:34,852
I want some kind of
actual interaction.

2428
02:02:34,931 --> 02:02:38,481
A real person, not just
the profile they put up.

2429
02:02:39,185 --> 02:02:41,233
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you saying something?

2430
02:02:41,437 --> 02:02:43,064
Yeah, okay,
I know you're joking.

2431
02:02:43,147 --> 02:02:44,347
But, I mean,
it's kind of true.

2432
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:47,369
You have been, you know, checking
your phone this whole time,

2433
02:02:47,443 --> 02:02:48,820
so, what're you
really doing?

2434
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:52,207
You don't care what your friends
are up to on a Saturday afternoon,

2435
02:02:52,282 --> 02:02:57,914
but you're also obviously not fully
experiencing my profound bitching.

2436
02:02:57,996 --> 02:03:02,502
So, yeah, it's like everyone's just
stuck in like an in-between state.

2437
02:03:02,584 --> 02:03:04,757
Not really
experiencing anything.

2438
02:03:04,836 --> 02:03:07,089
It's not an experience,
it's just information.

2439
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:10,054
Look. For example,

2440
02:03:10,133 --> 02:03:12,733
I just got the address of the club
where we're meeting them later,

2441
02:03:12,802 --> 02:03:16,147
so we won't be wandering the streets
of Austin lost for an hour tonight.

2442
02:03:16,222 --> 02:03:18,224
Thank you
very much, Facebook.

2443
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:20,026
And then I just texted
my mom back.

2444
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:22,524
Oh, that's groundbreaking.

2445
02:03:22,604 --> 02:03:25,153
She hasn't seen you in,
like, 55 minutes?

2446
02:03:26,941 --> 02:03:27,942
Oh...

2447
02:03:28,151 --> 02:03:30,370
Oh, my God,
most importantly,

2448
02:03:30,445 --> 02:03:33,369
Meg's family just got
a miniature pet pig.

2449
02:03:37,243 --> 02:03:41,498
Okay, you're right. That is
a really cute, tiny pig.

2450
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:43,379
Our lives can go on.

2451
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,881
I want one.

2452
02:03:50,882 --> 02:03:52,725
Nice shot.

2453
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,269
Yeah, just give the
lady at the front y'all's IDs

2454
02:03:55,345 --> 02:03:57,393
and, uh,
she should let you in.

2455
02:03:57,889 --> 02:04:00,108
It's Room 206, right?
Awesome. Mmm.

2456
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:02,944
It's not weird that
we're staying there, is it?

2457
02:04:03,019 --> 02:04:04,771
No, it's fine. Have fun.

2458
02:04:04,854 --> 02:04:06,197
Thank you.

2459
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:08,407
How long have you
guys been dating'?

2460
02:04:08,524 --> 02:04:10,242
About three months.

2461
02:04:11,027 --> 02:04:14,657
Yeah, we met at a party
and it's been chill.

2462
02:04:15,073 --> 02:04:17,121
Yeah, he seems cool.
Yeah, he is.

2463
02:04:17,867 --> 02:04:19,907
Does he go to UT, too?
Cool. Yeah.

2464
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:21,416
What does he study?

2465
02:04:21,496 --> 02:04:26,923
He's studying history and Italian,
I think, his minor, yeah.

2466
02:04:27,001 --> 02:04:28,969
Does he wanna
teach Italian?

2467
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:31,222
I think he's still
figuring stuff out.

2468
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:32,389
Yeah.
He'll figure it out.

2469
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:35,093
He's smart.
Smart, yeah.

2470
02:04:35,259 --> 02:04:37,353
So, where are you thinking about
living when you come here?

2471
02:04:37,428 --> 02:04:39,180
Um, I'm not really sure yet.

2472
02:04:39,263 --> 02:04:42,142
We're gonna look
at apartments tomorrow.

2473
02:04:42,225 --> 02:04:43,397
Um...

2474
02:04:43,601 --> 02:04:46,730
But I know my parents sort of were
expecting me to live in a dorm.

2475
02:04:47,146 --> 02:04:49,240
But I'm paying
my way through college,

2476
02:04:49,315 --> 02:04:51,659
so it doesn't
really matter that much.

2477
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:54,658
You don't have to listen to
your parents after you turn 18.

2478
02:04:54,737 --> 02:04:57,661
Especially if they're not
helping you financially.

2479
02:04:57,740 --> 02:04:59,617
That's what I figured.

2480
02:04:59,701 --> 02:05:02,204
But living in a dorm isn't so bad.
Yeah?

2481
02:05:02,286 --> 02:05:04,004
I mean, especially
if it's a coed dorm.

2482
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,081
Yeah.

2483
02:05:05,164 --> 02:05:09,385
I mean, I've never been around
so many cute guys at once.

2484
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:11,922
Like, college is really fun.

2485
02:05:13,589 --> 02:05:15,762
I'm excited.
It's great, yeah.

2486
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:30,481
Oh.

2487
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:32,051
The last death at the Hoover
Dam construction site

2488
02:06:32,126 --> 02:06:35,380
was his son,
Patrick Tierney,

2489
02:06:35,463 --> 02:06:40,060
who died on
December 20th, 1935,

2490
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,512
exactly 13 years to the day.

2491
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:46,141
See those
sorority girls over there?

2492
02:06:48,392 --> 02:06:50,019
I've just decided,

2493
02:06:50,103 --> 02:06:52,526
if you delete your Facebook
page, I'm pledging.

2494
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:56,568
Yeah, in just
a few years that's you,

2495
02:06:57,068 --> 02:06:58,570
and that's gonna be me.

2496
02:06:58,653 --> 02:07:02,408
...inlaid into the terrazzo
floors was a star map,

2497
02:07:02,532 --> 02:07:07,254
a celestial map of heavenly
bodies so accurately displayed

2498
02:07:07,328 --> 02:07:10,457
that one could chart the
procession of the pole star

2499
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:14,135
14,000 years into the future, such
that future generations upon...

2500
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,587
I wonder
what his deal is.

2501
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:17,968
I mean, he obviously
has money to eat here.

2502
02:07:18,339 --> 02:07:22,435
He just said. He's a UT
professor, tenure and everything.

2503
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:26,515
Look at all these people.

2504
02:07:26,681 --> 02:07:29,025
What're they even doing here
at 3:00 in the morning?

2505
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:31,819
What are we even doing here
at 3:00 in the morning'?

2506
02:07:32,061 --> 02:07:33,563
We know what
we're doing here.

2507
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,861
Queso. We have a purpose.

2508
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:39,827
Hell, yeah.

2509
02:07:39,902 --> 02:07:43,281
You know, by next summer,
this'll just be our lives.

2510
02:07:43,573 --> 02:07:44,825
Mmm.

2511
02:07:45,616 --> 02:07:50,793
Staying out all night, going
to shows, whatever we want.

2512
02:07:51,581 --> 02:07:53,174
We ever gonna go to class?

2513
02:07:54,625 --> 02:07:55,672
Sometimes.

2514
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,964
When it feels right.
When the inspiration hits.

2515
02:07:59,338 --> 02:08:00,681
Only then.

2516
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,392
Anything else?

2517
02:08:03,467 --> 02:08:05,811
Uh, more queso?
Yeah.

2518
02:08:12,977 --> 02:08:14,445
<i>Jesus.</i>

2519
02:08:15,021 --> 02:08:16,443
What?

2520
02:08:16,606 --> 02:08:19,109
I don't know, doesn't it all
seem a little overwhelming?

2521
02:08:19,192 --> 02:08:21,115
I mean, college?

2522
02:08:22,278 --> 02:08:25,532
I mean, I like the idea
of being away from home

2523
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:27,959
and gaining skills and getting
better at photography.

2524
02:08:28,034 --> 02:08:29,331
I just...

2525
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:30,707
I don't know,
I'm not counting on it

2526
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:33,881
being some big,
transformative experience.

2527
02:08:33,956 --> 02:08:35,958
I don't think
it's that transformative.

2528
02:08:36,042 --> 02:08:38,010
I just see it
<i>as</i> the next step.

2529
02:08:38,085 --> 02:08:39,712
But it's like
a preordained slot

2530
02:08:39,795 --> 02:08:42,969
that's already got
your name and number on it.

2531
02:08:43,591 --> 02:08:45,593
I don't think
it's the key to my future.

2532
02:08:46,135 --> 02:08:47,512
'Cause, I mean,
look at my mom.

2533
02:08:47,595 --> 02:08:50,815
She got her degree
and got a pretty good job.

2534
02:08:51,182 --> 02:08:52,399
She can pay her bills.

2535
02:08:52,475 --> 02:08:54,227
I like your mom.

2536
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,063
I like my mom, too.
I just mean...

2537
02:08:57,563 --> 02:09:00,487
Basically she's still just
as fuckin' confused <i>as</i> I am.

2538
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:04,282
Thank you.
Thanks.

2539
02:10:15,099 --> 02:10:17,067
- Hello?
- Hey.

2540
02:10:17,393 --> 02:10:18,440
Urn...

2541
02:10:18,519 --> 02:10:21,864
Did Sam tell you
we were gonna stay here?

2542
02:10:22,815 --> 02:10:24,658
No.

2543
02:10:24,734 --> 02:10:25,906
Sorry. Um...

2544
02:10:27,445 --> 02:10:30,790
She said you were out of
town for the weekend.

2545
02:10:30,865 --> 02:10:33,493
Yeah, I was.
I just got back.

2546
02:10:33,909 --> 02:10:35,877
Are you her brother?

2547
02:10:36,287 --> 02:10:38,790
Yeah, I'm Mason.

2548
02:10:38,873 --> 02:10:40,420
Um, this is Sheena.

2549
02:10:42,168 --> 02:10:44,591
Hello. Uh, great.

2550
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:48,925
All right. I'm gonna leave
my stuff here, if it's okay,

2551
02:10:49,008 --> 02:10:50,726
and get something to eat.

2552
02:10:50,843 --> 02:10:53,187
I'll just come back
in a little bit?

2553
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:56,482
Yeah, yeah, we have to
get out of here soon anyway.

2554
02:10:57,933 --> 02:10:59,685
All right.
It's nice meeting you.

2555
02:10:59,769 --> 02:11:01,988
- Yeah. You, too.
- Sorry!

2556
02:11:09,111 --> 02:11:11,330
- That was so awkward.
Mmm-hmm.

2557
02:11:34,512 --> 02:11:36,810
Mason,
silver-medal winner.

2558
02:11:38,307 --> 02:11:39,399
Congratulations!

2559
02:11:39,475 --> 02:11:40,522
Thank you.

2560
02:11:40,643 --> 02:11:42,816
Heard you got a scholarship.
Yeah.

2561
02:11:42,978 --> 02:11:44,571
Yeah, every little
bit helps, you know.

2562
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:46,007
Yeah. When you gonna
go out there'?

2563
02:11:46,023 --> 02:11:47,775
End of the summer, I think.

2564
02:11:47,858 --> 02:11:51,783
Work some more before then, try
to save up some money, at least.

2565
02:11:52,113 --> 02:11:54,491
Yeah, before you have to
fend for yourself. Yeah.

2566
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:56,412
Yeah, that's the idea.

2567
02:11:56,742 --> 02:11:58,102
Well, how are you
feeling about it?

2568
02:11:58,369 --> 02:11:59,996
Excited, you know.

2569
02:12:00,121 --> 02:12:02,340
But kind of half-excited,
half-terrified.

2570
02:12:02,498 --> 02:12:04,375
Yeah, kind of that
voluptuous panic.

2571
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:06,005
Yeah. Exactly.

2572
02:12:06,085 --> 02:12:08,804
Well, it's gonna be good.
It's gonna be crazy good.

2573
02:12:08,879 --> 02:12:11,382
I liked college a lot
better than high school.

2574
02:12:11,465 --> 02:12:13,559
You kinda find your people
in college, you know?

2575
02:12:13,759 --> 02:12:14,976
Exactly.

2576
02:12:15,052 --> 02:12:16,178
You'll be fine.

2577
02:12:16,262 --> 02:12:18,640
You got a good heart, just
follow your heart. Yeah?

2578
02:12:18,722 --> 02:12:20,269
Thanks.
Good luck.

2579
02:12:20,349 --> 02:12:22,022
Don't forget to floss.

2580
02:12:35,197 --> 02:12:37,317
I just don't get why you're
being so fucking childish.

2581
02:12:37,324 --> 02:12:39,076
I'm not being childish!

2582
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,538
You're the one who made it into
this big thing by telling everyone!

2583
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:42,746
I haven't told anyone.

2584
02:12:42,997 --> 02:12:44,499
So Cynthia just
magically knows

2585
02:12:44,582 --> 02:12:46,050
you're going to the prom
with this loser,

2586
02:12:46,125 --> 02:12:47,593
even though you're not
dating him anymore?

2587
02:12:47,751 --> 02:12:48,968
She's my best friend.

2588
02:12:49,044 --> 02:12:51,797
Well, your best friend
has a big fucking mouth.

2589
02:12:52,089 --> 02:12:53,432
Take it up with her, then.

2590
02:12:53,507 --> 02:12:55,680
Why don't you just
tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaw

2591
02:12:55,759 --> 02:12:57,261
she can keep on talking,

2592
02:12:57,386 --> 02:12:58,933
<i>as</i> long as she
includes the truth,

2593
02:12:59,013 --> 02:13:01,232
which is that we wouldn't
be having this conversation

2594
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:04,519
if your college boyfriend weren't
out of town this weekend.

2595
02:13:05,603 --> 02:13:07,071
You had already
bought the tickets.

2596
02:13:07,813 --> 02:13:09,440
It's just prom,
it's not like it matters.

2597
02:13:09,523 --> 02:13:11,043
I'm just trying to
be friends with you.

2598
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:14,362
It's just humiliating.
I can't do that.

2599
02:13:15,571 --> 02:13:17,790
Mister I-Don't-Care-
What-Anyone-Else-Thinks-Of-Me.

2600
02:13:17,865 --> 02:13:18,957
Fuck anyone else!

2601
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:23,379
I care what I think of me,
which isn't much right now.

2602
02:13:23,787 --> 02:13:25,755
King of the Pity Prom.

2603
02:13:27,124 --> 02:13:28,546
Fine. We're not going.

2604
02:13:29,084 --> 02:13:30,586
Great.

2605
02:13:40,804 --> 02:13:42,477
Why are we even...

2606
02:13:45,142 --> 02:13:47,315
I mean, we both knew
this was coming.

2607
02:13:47,394 --> 02:13:49,522
I'm just the one
who did something about it.

2608
02:13:49,605 --> 02:13:51,073
Yeah, fucking
some college guy.

2609
02:13:51,148 --> 02:13:52,445
Oh, fuck you!

2610
02:13:54,026 --> 02:13:55,118
I don't regret anything.

2611
02:13:55,194 --> 02:13:56,946
Of course you don't.

2612
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:58,997
You know, it's actually
kind of a relief

2613
02:13:59,073 --> 02:14:01,576
not to have to be around someone
who's so gloomy all the time.

2614
02:14:02,451 --> 02:14:03,703
The world's not so horrible.

2615
02:14:03,786 --> 02:14:06,756
Not everything's some big
conspiracy against humanity.

2616
02:14:06,830 --> 02:14:08,457
It's great that
you can think that way.

2617
02:14:08,541 --> 02:14:13,297
You know, I'm sure dating a jock
really helps to clear the mind.

2618
02:14:14,088 --> 02:14:17,513
He's not a jock, okay? He just
happens to be on the lacrosse team.

2619
02:14:18,425 --> 02:14:20,385
We're all going to other
schools next year anyway.

2620
02:14:20,427 --> 02:14:22,680
It's not some
super-serious relationship.

2621
02:14:22,763 --> 02:14:24,936
Oh, great. I feel
so much better now.

2622
02:14:25,808 --> 02:14:27,151
We're just having fun.

2623
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:29,027
I bet he's having fun.

2624
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:30,487
Grow up, Mason.

2625
02:14:32,982 --> 02:14:34,782
It's not like I haven't
been with anyone else.

2626
02:14:36,569 --> 02:14:37,786
Who?

2627
02:14:38,445 --> 02:14:39,492
What do you care?

2628
02:14:40,322 --> 02:14:41,369
Who?

2629
02:14:41,991 --> 02:14:43,163
Does it matter?

2630
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:46,082
You're the one
who brought it up.

2631
02:14:52,376 --> 02:14:54,094
This is pointless.

2632
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:57,840
Now you're just trying
to be an asshole.

2633
02:15:02,303 --> 02:15:04,931
Holy crap, I would rather
have my balls clawed off

2634
02:15:05,014 --> 02:15:07,233
than ever sit through
anything like that ever again.

2635
02:15:08,225 --> 02:15:10,819
Well, you never,
ever have to.

2636
02:15:10,894 --> 02:15:12,771
Oh, my God, thank you.

2637
02:15:12,855 --> 02:15:14,857
Give me that.
Dude, it's all you.

2638
02:15:15,065 --> 02:15:16,738
Drink up.

2639
02:15:19,236 --> 02:15:20,704
So you coming out
with me tonight, brother?

2640
02:15:20,779 --> 02:15:22,281
Should be some pretty
awesome stuff happening.

2641
02:15:22,364 --> 02:15:25,709
Naw, dude, I'm going to this
show with my dad in Austin.

2642
02:15:25,784 --> 02:15:27,457
His friend's playing.

2643
02:15:28,704 --> 02:15:30,752
Have fun with that, I guess.

2644
02:15:32,374 --> 02:15:36,345
Fuck, there are so many cars here.
I don't wanna go in there!

2645
02:15:36,962 --> 02:15:39,215
Dude, you will have
so much fun.

2646
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:42,810
Your family loves you!
Have a swell time.

2647
02:15:42,885 --> 02:15:45,229
Fuck you.
You're coming in with me.

2648
02:15:45,387 --> 02:15:47,481
Oh, no. Shit, no.
Yes.

2649
02:15:47,556 --> 02:15:49,729
Yes, you are. My mom loves you.
You have to say hi.

2650
02:15:51,894 --> 02:15:53,896
Do you want to hurt her feelings?
Mmm-mmm.

2651
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:56,197
Well, then,
let's go get 'em!

2652
02:15:56,565 --> 02:15:59,819
Just for a second. Just a
second, seriously.

2653
02:16:00,569 --> 02:16:03,493
You know, you're in sort
of enemy territory here.

2654
02:16:03,572 --> 02:16:04,573
We're aware.

2655
02:16:15,292 --> 02:16:17,215
Look who's here!

2656
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:20,547
Hey!

2657
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:33,360
Get a job!

2658
02:16:35,187 --> 02:16:36,279
Congratulations!

2659
02:16:36,355 --> 02:16:37,777
No, no, no! Wait.
We're gonna take pictures.

2660
02:16:37,856 --> 02:16:39,449
Put it back on.

2661
02:16:39,608 --> 02:16:40,860
Can you get a camera?

2662
02:16:40,943 --> 02:16:42,365
Congratulations, baby.

2663
02:16:42,444 --> 02:16:44,284
I don't know you, but congratulations!

2664
02:16:44,988 --> 02:16:47,616
All right, look here.

2665
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,702
Smile.
Here we go.

2666
02:16:49,785 --> 02:16:51,332
Oh, that's a good one.

2667
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:53,797
And good. Got it.

2668
02:16:53,997 --> 02:16:56,170
We need...
Sam, where are you?

2669
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:57,467
- Samantha!
- Sam.

2670
02:16:58,043 --> 02:16:59,215
And where's
Mason Senior?

2671
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:01,342
I'm feeling generous.
Come here.

2672
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:06,890
Great.
And beautiful!

2673
02:17:06,969 --> 02:17:08,937
I'll email these
to everyone.

2674
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:12,057
Don't even start.
Don't start, don't start.

2675
02:17:22,151 --> 02:17:24,404
Can't believe you guys came all this way.
It means a lot to me.

2676
02:17:24,486 --> 02:17:25,612
Mmm...

2677
02:17:25,696 --> 02:17:28,700
We wouldn't have
missed it for anything!

2678
02:17:28,782 --> 02:17:33,083
I'm so proud of you.
Congratulations.

2679
02:17:33,495 --> 02:17:36,669
I'm really sorry that Lee couldn't be here.
He's on his senior trip.

2680
02:17:36,874 --> 02:17:38,421
No, tell him I said hi.
I will.

2681
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,923
Abby, I didn't even recognize you.
How old are you now?

2682
02:17:41,086 --> 02:17:42,133
I'm 13.

2683
02:17:42,379 --> 02:17:43,596
Wow.

2684
02:17:47,176 --> 02:17:49,349
All right,
let's top her off.

2685
02:17:50,095 --> 02:17:51,597
You want some, doll?

2686
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:54,308
Um, sure,
whatever. Yeah.

2687
02:17:54,391 --> 02:17:55,643
<i>I got you something.</i>

2688
02:17:57,352 --> 02:17:58,444
What is it?

2689
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:01,148
That is a savings bond.
That is worth something.

2690
02:18:01,231 --> 02:18:03,031
It's better than money.
You'd just spend that.

2691
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:06,616
God, is that your mom?

2692
02:18:06,695 --> 02:18:08,993
Yeah. Yeah. That's her. Wow.

2693
02:18:09,865 --> 02:18:12,618
Three-second rule.
Put it on your plate.

2694
02:18:13,202 --> 02:18:14,294
Such a good dad.
Really.

2695
02:18:14,369 --> 02:18:15,461
I know.
I'm trying to help.

2696
02:18:15,537 --> 02:18:17,897
Come here, you guys. I want to
make a little toast to Mason.

2697
02:18:19,917 --> 02:18:22,591
Now, Mason, I know you didn't
really want to have a party today,

2698
02:18:22,669 --> 02:18:24,512
but we did.

2699
02:18:24,588 --> 02:18:28,468
And you only graduate high
school once in your life.

2700
02:18:29,343 --> 02:18:32,768
So I want to celebrate you
and this next phase.

2701
02:18:32,846 --> 02:18:34,486
And you're gonna learn
so much in college,

2702
02:18:34,556 --> 02:18:35,716
you're gonna have
so much fun.

2703
02:18:35,724 --> 02:18:37,567
You're gonna have
inspiring teachers,

2704
02:18:37,643 --> 02:18:40,863
you're gonna learn more
about your art.

2705
02:18:40,938 --> 02:18:42,815
I love you, babe.
So proud of you.

2706
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,909
- To Mason.
- To Mason!

2707
02:18:46,902 --> 02:18:47,949
- To Mason.
- Here, here!

2708
02:18:50,197 --> 02:18:52,120
All right,
you're up, kid.

2709
02:18:52,908 --> 02:18:54,080
Oh, uh...

2710
02:18:54,993 --> 02:18:59,840
All right, uh... Well, Mason,
I'll make a toast to the future.

2711
02:19:00,165 --> 02:19:01,542
To your future.

2712
02:19:01,625 --> 02:19:03,753
You know, it's been
a little sketchy

2713
02:19:03,836 --> 02:19:05,179
this end of
the school year here,

2714
02:19:05,254 --> 02:19:07,473
trying to figure out
what school to go to.

2715
02:19:07,548 --> 02:19:10,427
Mason told me
that he wanted

2716
02:19:10,509 --> 02:19:12,603
to get <i>as</i> far away
from home as possible,

2717
02:19:12,678 --> 02:19:15,727
but still honor our agreement
that we pay in-state tuition,

2718
02:19:15,806 --> 02:19:17,228
which I do appreciate.

2719
02:19:17,307 --> 02:19:20,527
He's a prudent man and, uh,
he's gonna have a great future.

2720
02:19:20,602 --> 02:19:21,854
So here's to you, buddy.

2721
02:19:22,062 --> 02:19:23,382
To the future!

2722
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:25,236
Congratulations!

2723
02:19:26,775 --> 02:19:31,451
Mason Junior! High school
graduate, 18 and straight!

2724
02:19:33,282 --> 02:19:36,035
Just ignore him. My brother
needs to learn to pace himself.

2725
02:19:36,118 --> 02:19:39,213
I've not known you
<i>as</i> long as everybody here,

2726
02:19:40,622 --> 02:19:45,753
but since I have known you, you've
grown a lot and I'm proud of you.

2727
02:19:46,461 --> 02:19:49,340
So, if this photography
thing doesn't work out,

2728
02:19:49,423 --> 02:19:50,424
you know
you always got a job.

2729
02:19:50,507 --> 02:19:52,555
Lose that earring. But...

2730
02:19:52,634 --> 02:19:54,728
Uh, you know, maybe I can
get you front of house.

2731
02:19:54,803 --> 02:19:56,271
All right.
To you, buddy!

2732
02:19:59,057 --> 02:20:00,479
Sam, say something!

2733
02:20:01,268 --> 02:20:02,770
Come on, Samantha.
Um...

2734
02:20:02,853 --> 02:20:04,526
Come on, darling.

2735
02:20:04,897 --> 02:20:06,240
Good luck.

2736
02:20:13,697 --> 02:20:14,994
Aw...

2737
02:20:15,824 --> 02:20:17,792
So you broke up
with your girlfriend?

2738
02:20:17,868 --> 02:20:19,791
Yeah, yeah, just recently.

2739
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:21,042
What was her name?

2740
02:20:21,121 --> 02:20:23,340
Sheena.

2741
02:20:23,749 --> 02:20:25,922
She's gonna go to
college with you'?

2742
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:27,344
No.
No?

2743
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:29,379
Hmm. She's staying in
this part of Texas.

2744
02:20:29,463 --> 02:20:30,635
Okay.

2745
02:20:30,714 --> 02:20:32,216
You need a ride
to college?

2746
02:20:35,093 --> 02:20:37,437
I just wanted to say hello
before you got out of here.

2747
02:20:37,512 --> 02:20:39,606
You guys met before, haven't you?
Annie, Aunt Jen?

2748
02:20:39,681 --> 02:20:41,183
Yeah, we met at, uh...

2749
02:20:41,266 --> 02:20:42,768
Sam's graduation.
Oh, yeah.

2750
02:20:42,851 --> 02:20:44,444
And with your little one.
Where is he?

2751
02:20:44,519 --> 02:20:46,897
Oh, he's at home.

2752
02:20:46,980 --> 02:20:48,980
Remember? He was such a
pain in Sam's thing that...

2753
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:50,901
I would love to see him.

2754
02:20:50,984 --> 02:20:53,032
We have a special weekend
this weekend, so...

2755
02:20:53,153 --> 02:20:55,326
I'm so glad you
found her, I really am.

2756
02:20:55,405 --> 02:20:57,533
You've got him at
a good time, I think.

2757
02:20:57,616 --> 02:20:59,459
I think so, too.
Yeah.

2758
02:20:59,534 --> 02:21:00,751
It's good to see you two.

2759
02:21:00,827 --> 02:21:01,953
Nice to see you,
too, Jen.

2760
02:21:02,037 --> 02:21:03,414
So proud of your boy.

2761
02:21:03,497 --> 02:21:05,374
Yeah. Yeah,
we all are.

2762
02:21:08,543 --> 02:21:10,796
She's a bitch and a half.

2763
02:21:12,506 --> 02:21:13,553
You got to
remember, you're going

2764
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:15,054
to college, though,
all right?

2765
02:21:15,133 --> 02:21:18,103
And if you're anything
like me or your old man,

2766
02:21:18,178 --> 02:21:20,476
you're gonna be pulling
down some serious wool.

2767
02:21:20,555 --> 02:21:22,478
You're gonna be tapping
some masterful gap.

2768
02:21:22,557 --> 02:21:24,104
You're gonna be doing
some good work out there.

2769
02:21:24,184 --> 02:21:26,562
Think about it. Awful lot
of flowers in that bouquet.

2770
02:21:26,812 --> 02:21:28,155
But you got to
do me a favor.

2771
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:30,310
You're going to be vulnerable
this summer, all right?

2772
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:33,403
Remember to use protection
during breakup sex.

2773
02:21:35,404 --> 02:21:37,907
This guy knows exactly of which I speak.

2774
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:40,584
Look what
happened to him. Voila'.

2775
02:21:40,742 --> 02:21:42,085
Steven.

2776
02:21:43,412 --> 02:21:44,914
Cheers.

2777
02:21:46,581 --> 02:21:47,707
It's not that simple.

2778
02:21:47,791 --> 02:21:50,465
Four more years.
Four more years.

2779
02:21:51,003 --> 02:21:52,630
I'm just saying.

2780
02:21:55,424 --> 02:21:57,677
Do y'all recycle?
Should I...

2781
02:21:57,759 --> 02:21:59,011
I have one started there.

2782
02:21:59,094 --> 02:22:01,313
Oh, yeah, right. Great.

2783
02:22:05,017 --> 02:22:07,395
Am I your only ex at this party?

2784
02:22:07,894 --> 02:22:10,773
Yes. I'm not your
only wife here, though.

2785
02:22:13,108 --> 02:22:14,360
Yeah.

2786
02:22:16,778 --> 02:22:19,907
Can you believe they're
both out of high school'?

2787
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:22,789
No. No, I can't.

2788
02:22:25,287 --> 02:22:28,791
You did a great job with
both of them, by the way.

2789
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:31,214
Thanks for saying that.

2790
02:22:31,835 --> 02:22:33,052
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

2791
02:22:33,128 --> 02:22:34,345
Well, it's true.

2792
02:22:34,838 --> 02:22:36,215
Thank you.

2793
02:22:37,966 --> 02:22:39,593
You're doing it
all over again, huh?

2794
02:22:39,676 --> 02:22:41,599
I know, I know, right?

2795
02:22:42,262 --> 02:22:45,983
It's gonna be 15 years
till I have an empty nest.

2796
02:22:46,475 --> 02:22:47,476
Hmm.

2797
02:22:47,601 --> 02:22:50,980
But I'd love to pitch in,
help with this, if I could.

2798
02:22:51,063 --> 02:22:52,906
I mean, it's so great
that you did this.

2799
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:55,075
Can I just
give you a little?

2800
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:56,867
I'd appreciate it
if I could.

2801
02:22:56,943 --> 02:22:58,536
Sure. Yeah.

2802
02:22:58,612 --> 02:23:00,080
But I don't
have any cash.

2803
02:23:00,155 --> 02:23:03,625
Oh, I know, it's in Annie's purse.
I'll be right back.

2804
02:23:10,832 --> 02:23:13,585
So it sucks. I mean, the guy's
a college lacrosse player.

2805
02:23:13,668 --> 02:23:15,090
What are you gonna do?

2806
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:17,423
She didn't even
like sports.

2807
02:23:17,506 --> 02:23:18,849
You want a beer?

2808
02:23:18,924 --> 02:23:20,141
No, that's all right.

2809
02:23:20,217 --> 02:23:21,719
You can have one.
It's okay.

2810
02:23:22,219 --> 02:23:24,267
Yeah, well,
for what it's worth,

2811
02:23:24,346 --> 02:23:28,522
we've all been through the exact
same thing at one point or another.

2812
02:23:29,142 --> 02:23:31,816
It's not the same, though. I
mean, you never got to know her.

2813
02:23:31,895 --> 02:23:34,569
No, I know, I know.
It's not the same.

2814
02:23:35,232 --> 02:23:37,280
I just don't know
what I did wrong.

2815
02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:39,657
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, man.

2816
02:23:40,821 --> 02:23:42,744
Hey.
Hey, Mason.

2817
02:23:42,823 --> 02:23:45,667
We're up here raiding the green room.
Hope that's okay.

2818
02:23:45,742 --> 02:23:46,834
That's totally cool.

2819
02:23:46,910 --> 02:23:47,911
All right.

2820
02:23:51,206 --> 02:23:53,334
Wow! Is that MJ?

2821
02:23:53,416 --> 02:23:55,009
Uh-huh, right?

2822
02:23:55,293 --> 02:23:56,886
Unbelievable.

2823
02:23:57,671 --> 02:24:00,049
Well, we just decided to come a
little early, check you out.

2824
02:24:00,132 --> 02:24:02,510
That's cool man, let me finish up.
I'll be up in a minute.

2825
02:24:02,592 --> 02:24:05,436
All right. I guarantee you,
you didn't do anything wrong.

2826
02:24:06,012 --> 02:24:08,106
These high school love
things, they never work out.

2827
02:24:08,181 --> 02:24:09,353
Here, come here.

2828
02:24:09,432 --> 02:24:12,732
I mean, everybody’s just
changing so much, you know'?

2829
02:24:12,811 --> 02:24:16,315
The odds of two young people staying
on the same wavelength are...

2830
02:24:16,439 --> 02:24:19,033
Yeah, but still... Look,
and I also guarantee you

2831
02:24:19,109 --> 02:24:20,452
that every day
of your life

2832
02:24:20,527 --> 02:24:22,575
that you spend crying
over some silly girl

2833
02:24:22,654 --> 02:24:25,498
is a complete
waste of time.

2834
02:24:25,574 --> 02:24:27,121
She wasn't
a silly girl, though.

2835
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,248
I mean,
she's a serious person.

2836
02:24:29,327 --> 02:24:31,170
And I really
thought we were...

2837
02:24:31,246 --> 02:24:32,372
What?

2838
02:24:32,455 --> 02:24:34,423
I don't know.

2839
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:38,591
Here's the truth. Women are
never satisfied, okay?

2840
02:24:38,712 --> 02:24:40,552
They're always looking
to potentially trade up,

2841
02:24:40,589 --> 02:24:42,011
and that's,
I'm sorry to say,

2842
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:44,434
what I think has happened to
you, my fine-feathered friend.

2843
02:24:44,509 --> 02:24:46,011
What does that even mean?

2844
02:24:46,094 --> 02:24:49,519
It means don't hand over the controls
to your self-esteem to Sheila.

2845
02:24:49,598 --> 02:24:50,895
Sheena.
All right.

2846
02:24:50,974 --> 02:24:52,851
It means you are
responsible for you,

2847
02:24:52,934 --> 02:24:55,858
not your girlfriend, not
your mom, not me, you.

2848
02:24:55,937 --> 02:24:58,360
And if you truly
take care of you,

2849
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:01,239
you will be amazed at
how much girls like Sheena

2850
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:03,662
start lining up
at your front door.

2851
02:25:04,279 --> 02:25:05,326
Great.

2852
02:25:05,864 --> 02:25:08,538
You just gotta separate yourself
from the pack in some way.

2853
02:25:08,617 --> 02:25:12,542
Excel at something, you know, and
then you have your pick of the litter

2854
02:25:12,621 --> 02:25:14,999
when the front-runner hussies
start sniffing around.

2855
02:25:15,081 --> 02:25:17,630
So what you're saying
is I should take up lacrosse.

2856
02:25:18,126 --> 02:25:19,548
Exactly.

2857
02:25:19,628 --> 02:25:21,471
Or you could,
you know, start a band.

2858
02:25:21,671 --> 02:25:25,471
Worked for me a long time ago. I
think it's still working for Jimmy.

2859
02:25:25,592 --> 02:25:28,186
Or you just
keep taking pictures.

2860
02:25:28,637 --> 02:25:31,015
She hated the pictures
I took of her.

2861
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:32,899
I'm sick to death
of her, okay?

2862
02:25:32,974 --> 02:25:36,274
I only met her a few times, and
yes, she was cute, all right,

2863
02:25:36,353 --> 02:25:39,027
but truth be told, I always
thought she was a little bit...

2864
02:25:39,105 --> 02:25:41,199
You know, a little
bit too square for you.

2865
02:25:41,274 --> 02:25:43,743
You know,
not quite the same vibe.

2866
02:25:43,818 --> 02:25:44,865
You really thought that?

2867
02:25:44,945 --> 02:25:46,697
On some subtle,
lower level.

2868
02:25:47,197 --> 02:25:50,542
I mean, I wasn't surprised

2869
02:25:50,617 --> 02:25:54,838
when it turned out she was interested in
some Knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?

2870
02:25:54,913 --> 02:25:59,760
I mean, bottom line is, it's all
timing with these things, you know.

2871
02:26:00,252 --> 02:26:02,471
I mean,
take your mom and me.

2872
02:26:02,545 --> 02:26:05,515
I think I probably
turned into the boring,

2873
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:07,308
castrated guy
she wanted me to be

2874
02:26:07,425 --> 02:26:09,598
15, 20
years ago, you know?

2875
02:26:09,678 --> 02:26:11,931
I'm not saying she was wrong
to be pissed, I'm not.

2876
02:26:12,013 --> 02:26:13,606
I'm just saying
that she could've been

2877
02:26:13,682 --> 02:26:15,559
a little more patient,
little more forgiving.

2878
02:26:15,642 --> 02:26:18,270
Would've saved me that
parade of drunken assholes.

2879
02:26:27,487 --> 02:26:28,704
So, what's the point?

2880
02:26:30,407 --> 02:26:31,533
Of what?

2881
02:26:32,492 --> 02:26:35,041
I don't know,
any of this. Everything.

2882
02:26:36,288 --> 02:26:39,087
Everything?
What's the point?

2883
02:26:39,165 --> 02:26:41,714
I mean,
I sure as shit don't know.

2884
02:26:42,294 --> 02:26:44,046
Neither does
anybody else, okay?

2885
02:26:44,129 --> 02:26:46,723
We're all just
winging it, you know?

2886
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:48,808
The good news is
you're feeling stuff.

2887
02:26:48,883 --> 02:26:51,636
And you've got to
hold on to that.

2888
02:26:52,095 --> 02:26:55,269
You do. I mean, you get older
and you don't feel as much.

2889
02:26:55,348 --> 02:26:57,100
Your skin gets tougher.

2890
02:26:57,183 --> 02:26:58,685
The point is those
pictures you took,

2891
02:26:58,768 --> 02:27:02,648
thousands of submissions from all
over the state, and you won.

2892
02:27:03,106 --> 02:27:04,904
Well, I got silver.

2893
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:07,277
And nine other people did, too.
I'm gonna kill you.

2894
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:09,704
I'm trying to tell you
that I believe in you, Mason.

2895
02:27:09,779 --> 02:27:11,122
I think you're really special,

2896
02:27:11,197 --> 02:27:13,575
and if some girl doesn't see
that, then fuck her, you know.

2897
02:27:15,243 --> 02:27:18,543
Hey, this next one of 'em goes
out to a young man in the house.

2898
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:21,667
Whoo-hoo! Known him since
he was just a small boy.

2899
02:27:21,875 --> 02:27:26,346
Now he's all graduated from high
school and making me feel old.

2900
02:27:27,756 --> 02:27:30,350
Happy high school
graduation, Mason.

2901
02:27:57,786 --> 02:27:59,129
Thank you.

2902
02:27:59,913 --> 02:28:03,543
Okay, guys, let's be clear. We're gonna
break this into four categories.

2903
02:28:03,625 --> 02:28:05,878
One, anything you want to
keep from your childhood

2904
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,257
and you're taking with you.

2905
02:28:07,337 --> 02:28:11,387
Two, throwing away.
Three, donating.

2906
02:28:11,674 --> 02:28:13,893
And four, whatever you
want to try to sell

2907
02:28:13,968 --> 02:28:15,390
at the garage sale
next weekend,

2908
02:28:15,470 --> 02:28:17,723
whatever we don't sell,
we're donating.

2909
02:28:18,306 --> 02:28:22,231
Doesn't the apartment have like an
attic, or storage or something?

2910
02:28:22,602 --> 02:28:24,900
No. You're missing the point.

2911
02:28:25,355 --> 02:28:28,154
We're not gonna drag a bunch of
crap to Mom's tiny apartment.

2912
02:28:28,858 --> 02:28:30,735
Can't believe
we're moving again.

2913
02:28:30,819 --> 02:28:32,162
No, I'm moving.

2914
02:28:32,237 --> 02:28:34,990
You moved two years ago. You
have an apartment in Austin.

2915
02:28:35,323 --> 02:28:37,246
Mason is
moving in the fall.

2916
02:28:37,659 --> 02:28:39,206
I'm done.

2917
02:28:39,285 --> 02:28:41,458
This'll be great for me.
I'll have all these options.

2918
02:28:41,538 --> 02:28:43,165
I could take a sabbatical.

2919
02:28:43,248 --> 02:28:45,626
I could get some writing done,
try to get published.

2920
02:28:45,708 --> 02:28:47,756
What about Christmas, though?
What are we gonna do?

2921
02:28:47,836 --> 02:28:49,713
I'm not sharing
a room with him.

2922
02:28:49,796 --> 02:28:51,469
One of you will
sleep on the couch,

2923
02:28:51,548 --> 02:28:53,676
and we'll use that
blow-up mattress.

2924
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:56,302
How am I supposed
to do my laundry?

2925
02:28:57,178 --> 02:29:00,102
Sam, I'm gently
pushing you out of the nest.

2926
02:29:00,598 --> 02:29:05,024
And on your way down, you may
magically find some quarters

2927
02:29:05,103 --> 02:29:07,697
that you use to do laundry
in your own apartment.

2928
02:29:08,022 --> 02:29:11,367
Come on!
You guys are adults!

2929
02:29:11,609 --> 02:29:15,364
You need to take some responsibility.
Now, what do you want?

2930
02:29:17,031 --> 02:29:19,079
I'm gonna get
the veggie burger.

2931
02:29:19,159 --> 02:29:21,253
I'm not having anything,
not hungry.

2932
02:29:21,870 --> 02:29:23,747
What's wrong with you?

2933
02:29:24,038 --> 02:29:25,381
I'm sick.

2934
02:29:26,166 --> 02:29:29,010
What is it, your head?
Do you have a fever?

2935
02:29:29,252 --> 02:29:31,254
She's pregnant.

2936
02:29:32,005 --> 02:29:35,680
No. To be honest, I drank
way too much last night.

2937
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,768
You weren't driving, were you?
No, no.

2938
02:29:38,303 --> 02:29:41,227
Cary's back home, too,
and we just hung out.

2939
02:29:41,306 --> 02:29:45,106
You know, peach Smirnoffs,
they just go down so easy.

2940
02:29:45,185 --> 02:29:48,189
No, no. Hey,
that's not an excuse.

2941
02:29:48,271 --> 02:29:50,023
You can still pack boxes.

2942
02:29:50,106 --> 02:29:53,030
These people want to move in
as soon as possible.

2943
02:29:53,109 --> 02:29:55,612
Hi, guys.
I'm Ernesto, how are you?

2944
02:29:56,905 --> 02:29:58,248
You probably
don't remember me,

2945
02:29:58,323 --> 02:30:00,451
but I worked on your
septic line years ago.

2946
02:30:00,533 --> 02:30:01,580
Oh, yeah.

2947
02:30:02,368 --> 02:30:04,416
Believe it or not,
you changed my life.

2948
02:30:04,496 --> 02:30:06,715
You told me that day
that I was smart

2949
02:30:06,789 --> 02:30:08,757
and that I should
go to school.

2950
02:30:09,167 --> 02:30:11,966
I took your advice. I signed
up for English classes,

2951
02:30:12,086 --> 02:30:14,088
and then a year later,
I went to community college

2952
02:30:14,172 --> 02:30:15,372
and I got my
Associates degree,

2953
02:30:15,423 --> 02:30:17,517
and I'm working on my
bachelor's now at Texas State.

2954
02:30:17,592 --> 02:30:19,094
And also one of
the managers here.

2955
02:30:19,302 --> 02:30:20,428
That's great.

2956
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:23,227
It's good to see you,
because I really wanted

2957
02:30:23,306 --> 02:30:25,934
a chance to
thank you for that.

2958
02:30:26,017 --> 02:30:28,486
Gracias. It really
meant a lot to me.

2959
02:30:29,562 --> 02:30:33,066
Don't worry about lunch. It's on me.
It's the least I can do.

2960
02:30:33,775 --> 02:30:36,619
You guys should listen to her.
She's a smart lady.

2961
02:30:37,278 --> 02:30:38,621
Thank you.

2962
02:30:52,961 --> 02:30:54,241
Isn't that kind
of crazy, though,

2963
02:30:54,254 --> 02:30:55,722
that a computer
knows who you are

2964
02:30:55,797 --> 02:30:58,550
from just 20 questions
off a form?

2965
02:30:58,633 --> 02:31:01,853
I guess there are really only like
eight types of people in the world.

2966
02:31:01,928 --> 02:31:04,101
I mean, there are subsets
like male and female,

2967
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:08,026
but apparently we're not as unique
<i>as</i> we want to think we are.

2968
02:31:08,101 --> 02:31:10,149
Have you even
talked to this guy yet?

2969
02:31:10,311 --> 02:31:13,736
No, but we've been trading emails.
He seems pretty cool.

2970
02:31:13,815 --> 02:31:16,785
He's studying
literature and anthropology

2971
02:31:16,859 --> 02:31:20,079
and he's way into Bright Eyes,
so that's not so bad.

2972
02:31:20,238 --> 02:31:22,240
But, anyways, he was
telling me about how

2973
02:31:22,323 --> 02:31:26,078
the system they use for assigning
roommates is kinda spooky.

2974
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:30,210
The freshman satisfaction rate for
new roommates used to be like 60%,

2975
02:31:30,290 --> 02:31:33,294
and now it's 100,
just 'cause of the computer.

2976
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:36,884
Well, sounds like he'll be
a good roommate, then.

2977
02:31:37,630 --> 02:31:39,928
Yeah. But we
pretty much decided

2978
02:31:40,008 --> 02:31:42,261
that soon they won't even
need a questionnaire

2979
02:31:42,343 --> 02:31:45,643
'cause they'll just let the
NSA scan your digital ghost

2980
02:31:45,722 --> 02:31:47,690
and they'll tell you
who your roommate is

2981
02:31:47,765 --> 02:31:51,360
based on everything you've
ever said, written or clicked.

2982
02:31:51,728 --> 02:31:54,777
Did you put this
in here again?

2983
02:31:54,856 --> 02:31:56,779
I don't want it.

2984
02:31:56,858 --> 02:31:59,577
Come on, it's the first
picture you ever took.

2985
02:32:00,695 --> 02:32:03,539
All the more reason to
leave it behind, right?

2986
02:32:19,922 --> 02:32:22,220
What?
Nothing.

2987
02:32:22,342 --> 02:32:24,470
No, what is it?
It's nothing!

2988
02:32:25,887 --> 02:32:26,934
Mom.

2989
02:32:30,224 --> 02:32:32,773
This is the worst
day of my life.

2990
02:32:33,269 --> 02:32:34,521
What're you talking about?

2991
02:32:34,604 --> 02:32:35,821
I knew this day
was coming.

2992
02:32:35,897 --> 02:32:37,097
I didn't know
you were gonna be

2993
02:32:37,148 --> 02:32:38,900
so fuckin'
happy to be leaving.

2994
02:32:40,068 --> 02:32:43,663
I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
What do you expect?

2995
02:32:44,238 --> 02:32:47,287
You know what I'm realizing? My
life is just gonna go, like that.

2996
02:32:47,617 --> 02:32:49,585
This series of milestones.

2997
02:32:49,744 --> 02:32:53,248
Getting married. Having kids.
Getting divorced.

2998
02:32:53,414 --> 02:32:55,758
The time that we thought
you were dyslexic.

2999
02:32:55,833 --> 02:32:57,380
When I taught you
how to ride a bike.

3000
02:32:58,461 --> 02:33:01,681
Getting divorced again.
Getting my master's degree.

3001
02:33:01,756 --> 02:33:03,599
Finally getting
the job I wanted.

3002
02:33:03,675 --> 02:33:07,100
Sending Samantha off to college.
Sending you off to college.

3003
02:33:07,428 --> 02:33:09,351
You know what's next'? Huh?

3004
02:33:09,430 --> 02:33:11,432
It's my fuckin' funeral!

3005
02:33:13,643 --> 02:33:15,611
Just go!
And leave my picture!

3006
02:33:18,022 --> 02:33:21,617
Aren't you jumping ahead by,
like, 40 years or something?

3007
02:33:24,445 --> 02:33:27,289
I just thought
there would be more.

3008
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:44,843
Hey, you must be Mason.

3009
02:35:45,044 --> 02:35:46,091
Yeah. Dalton, right?

3010
02:35:46,212 --> 02:35:48,431
Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.
Definitely.

3011
02:35:48,506 --> 02:35:50,099
Are you cool with
this side of the room?

3012
02:35:50,258 --> 02:35:51,305
Yeah.

3013
02:35:51,384 --> 02:35:53,887
Got in this morning,
just moved my shit in, man.

3014
02:35:53,970 --> 02:35:56,974
Well, yeah, I don't care.
No worries.

3015
02:35:57,056 --> 02:35:58,353
Cool. Can I help you
with anything, man?

3016
02:35:58,432 --> 02:35:59,649
Any bags, any of that
stuff need brought in?

3017
02:35:59,725 --> 02:36:03,195
I just got like one box left,
I packed pretty light.

3018
02:36:03,271 --> 02:36:04,488
But I appreciate it.

3019
02:36:04,564 --> 02:36:05,844
It's my pleasure, man.
Of course.

3020
02:36:08,442 --> 02:36:11,286
Um... Are you going to
the orientation mixer thing?

3021
02:36:12,488 --> 02:36:15,037
Orientation mixer thing?

3022
02:36:15,116 --> 02:36:16,709
Fuck no, man,
I'm not going to that,

3023
02:36:16,784 --> 02:36:17,956
and neither are you,
by the way.

3024
02:36:17,994 --> 02:36:20,497
We got way better stuff to
be doing, dude. All right.

3025
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:21,877
You ready?
Yeah.

3026
02:36:21,956 --> 02:36:24,209
Hey, Barb, this is my roommate Mason.
Mason, Barb.

3027
02:36:24,292 --> 02:36:25,339
- Hi.
- Hey.

3028
02:36:25,668 --> 02:36:26,760
You coming with us?

3029
02:36:27,253 --> 02:36:28,300
Where're you going?

3030
02:36:28,796 --> 02:36:30,719
Hiking. Yeah, man,
you should come.

3031
02:36:30,798 --> 02:36:32,675
If we leave now we can catch the
late afternoon at Big Bend.

3032
02:36:32,758 --> 02:36:33,850
You ever been before, man?

3033
02:36:33,926 --> 02:36:35,644
Yeah, but not since
I was really little.

3034
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:39,975
Then all the more reason to come now, man.
That's why we're here, dude.

3035
02:36:41,225 --> 02:36:43,523
Oh, Mason, this is
Nicole, Barb's roommate.

3036
02:36:44,103 --> 02:36:45,150
Hey, what's up?

3037
02:36:45,396 --> 02:36:47,740
Hi.
Mason, Nicole.

3038
02:36:47,815 --> 02:36:48,816
So, you game?

3039
02:36:50,067 --> 02:36:51,239
Sure.

3040
02:36:51,861 --> 02:36:53,784
Here,
have the rest of this.

3041
02:36:54,113 --> 02:36:57,208
Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick
in when we get in the mountains.

3042
02:36:57,283 --> 02:36:58,910
Awesome. Let's go.

3043
02:37:06,417 --> 02:37:08,169
Do they let you
major in that here?

3044
02:37:08,252 --> 02:37:12,348
Well, it's not that serious here, so
I kinda train outside of university,

3045
02:37:12,423 --> 02:37:15,393
but I'm taking all my basics like
History of Dance and all that.

3046
02:37:15,468 --> 02:37:17,266
Nice.
Yeah.

3047
02:37:17,762 --> 02:37:19,105
What do you teach?

3048
02:37:19,180 --> 02:37:20,432
Oh, gosh.

3049
02:37:21,015 --> 02:37:24,189
Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop.
Wow...

3050
02:37:24,727 --> 02:37:26,229
Which one's
your favorite?

3051
02:37:26,312 --> 02:37:27,404
Tap.

3052
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,527
Yeah?
Yeah.

3053
02:37:28,606 --> 02:37:32,952
You get to like make up all your
own sounds, and there's no rules.

3054
02:37:33,027 --> 02:37:34,404
Just like
creative freedom.

3055
02:37:34,487 --> 02:37:36,114
That's great.
Yeah.

3056
02:37:36,197 --> 02:37:37,744
That's why I love
teaching it, 'cause,

3057
02:37:37,823 --> 02:37:39,416
I don't know,
it's so beautiful to me,

3058
02:37:39,492 --> 02:37:41,836
and it's kind of dying
away in this generation,

3059
02:37:41,911 --> 02:37:43,311
so, to be a part
of bringing it back

3060
02:37:43,329 --> 02:37:44,569
to the kids is
really rewarding.

3061
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:45,832
Right, keeps it going.
Yeah.

3062
02:37:45,915 --> 02:37:46,916
How old are they?

3063
02:37:47,041 --> 02:37:48,588
Six to eight.
Wow.

3064
02:37:48,668 --> 02:37:52,298
Yeah. They have no fear, and
they're not self-conscious at all.

3065
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:54,428
They haven't reached
the awkward years yet.

3066
02:37:54,548 --> 02:37:56,721
Yeah, not yet. It's coming.

3067
02:38:12,775 --> 02:38:14,027
<i>Hey-</i>

3068
02:38:14,110 --> 02:38:15,578
Hey.

3069
02:38:25,997 --> 02:38:28,295
Dalton can be
crazy sometimes.

3070
02:38:28,916 --> 02:38:30,463
He seems cool, though.

3071
02:38:30,584 --> 02:38:33,258
Yeah. Yeah,
they're both really cool.

3072
02:38:36,757 --> 02:38:38,555
How are you feeling?

3073
02:38:40,594 --> 02:38:43,939
Great. Pretty great,
to be honest.

3074
02:38:45,307 --> 02:38:46,604
Good.

3075
02:38:49,395 --> 02:38:51,864
I'm really happy that
you're hangin' out with us.

3076
02:38:51,939 --> 02:38:54,613
Yeah. Me, too.

3077
02:38:56,068 --> 02:38:59,117
This moment's
having a falsieful whoregasm!

3078
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:02,329
It's like as if all of time
has unfolded before us

3079
02:39:02,408 --> 02:39:06,129
so we could stand here and look
out and scream, "Fuck, yeah!"

3080
02:39:12,501 --> 02:39:16,631
You know how everyone's always
saying, "Seize the moment"?

3081
02:39:19,091 --> 02:39:22,971
I don't know, I'm kinda thinking
it's the other way around.

3082
02:39:23,637 --> 02:39:26,607
You know, like,
the moment seizes us.

3083
02:39:26,682 --> 02:39:29,310
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

3084
02:39:30,227 --> 02:39:33,606
It's constant.
The moment, it's just...

3085
02:39:34,648 --> 02:39:37,652
It's like it's always
right now, you know?

3086
02:39:40,362 --> 02:39:41,784
Yeah.

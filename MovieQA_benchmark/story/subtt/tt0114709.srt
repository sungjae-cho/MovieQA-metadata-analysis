Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

161
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,223
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

All right, gangway, gangway.

- I thought I told him to pick these up.
-{ Ice Clinking In Glasses }

178
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,171
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

179
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:58,211
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

180
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:00,585

They're not lying down on the job.

G-G-Go on without me!

183
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:16,138

Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody--

187
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:41,703
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.

Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

194
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:01,673
Hey, I can dream,
can't I?

195

The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

Okay, second present.

- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

- It's a board game!
Repeat, Battleship!

207
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,535
- Yeah! All right!

208
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:36,455
Sorry there,

209
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:40,163
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're going' home.

210
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,596
So did I tell ya? Huh?
Nothing' to worry about.

211
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:45,924
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

212
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:48,739
Wait a minute. Oh!

present from the closet.

He's really excited about this one.

217
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:01,828
- Mom, what is it? { Gasps }

Turn him around!

224

Here, you're

225
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:25,053
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me! { Grunting }

- { Andy} Let's go to my room, guys!

- { Rex Screaming }
- Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

233

Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come! { Groans }

234
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:46,339
{ Boys Shouting }

235
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:47,037
{ Boys Shouting }

236
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:53,537
{ Boys Shouting }

237
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:57,148
{Andy} Hey, look,
its lasers light up. Take that, Zurg!

238
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:59,967
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

239
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:03,035
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

240
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,921
{ Mom } Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

241
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,320
{ Boys Shouting Excitedly }

242
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,407
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

243
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:24,920
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

244
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:27,033
- { Coughing }
-{Slinky} Woody?

245
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:30,432
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Uh, nothing'. Uh, nothing'.

246
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,146
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

247
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:35,637
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

248
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:39,357
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody. { Chuckles }

249
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:42,456
- { Gasps } Have you been replaced?
- What did I tell you earlier?

250
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:44,927
No one is getting replaced.

251
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,025
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there...

252
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,575
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

253
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,850
{ Gulps }

254
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,721
{Heavy Breathing}

255
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,400
- { Buzzes }
- Buzz Light year to Star Command.

256
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:19,770
Come in, Star Command.

257
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:22,138
-{ Buzzes }
-Star Command, come
in. Do you read me?

258
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:25,651
Why don't they answer?
{ Gasps } My ship!

259
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,513
Blast! This'll take
weeks to repair.

260
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:34,484
Buzz Light year mission log,
star date 4-0-7-2.

261
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,786
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 1 2.

262
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,274
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

263
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,769
The impact must've awoken me
from hyper sleep.

264
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:47,191
Terrain seems
a bit unstable.

265
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:50,456
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

266
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,891
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

267
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:54,843
- Hello!
- { Karate Yell }

268
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,330
{ Screams } Whoa! H-Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

269
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,803
- Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.
- { Buzzing }

270
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,321
- Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.
- { Buzzing Continues }

271
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:06,454
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

272
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,792
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

273
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:11,126
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

274
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:13,593
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

275
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,473
I'm Buzz Light year, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

276
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,939
My ship has crash-landed
here by mistake.

277
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:22,231
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

278
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,567
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

279
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

280
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:29,716
- Well, let's see. We got double-A's.
- { Gasps }

281
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:31,314
Watch yourself!.
Halt! Who goes there?

282
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,589
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

283
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:37,433
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

284
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,602
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

285
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,357
I am Buzz Light year.
I come in peace.

286
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,589
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

287
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,991
Bye-bye. Thank you!

288
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:50,937
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

289
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,651
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

290
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,404
- { Voice Box }
Buzz Light year to the rescue!
- { Toys } Oh!

291
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:58,675
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

292
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:01,362
- Only it’s--
- Only it sounds like a carran overit.

293
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:04,661
{ Hamm } Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

294
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,735
Probably all
copper wiring, huh?

295
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,709
So, uh, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

296
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:14,387
Well, no. Actually, I-I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

297
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:18,004
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit
of the Space Ranger Corps,

298
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,688
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion...

299
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,245
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

300
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,279
Oh, real ly?
I 'm from Playskool.

301
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:30,252
And I 'm from Mattel.
Well, I 'm not really from Mattel.

302
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:32,659
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

303
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,279
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

304
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:39,539
Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more
gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.

305
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:42,059
- { Buzzing }
- Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful.

306
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,784
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

307
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,058
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

308
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:50,060
It's not a laser! It's a--
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

309
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,660
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

310
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,619
All right, that's enough!

311
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:56,750
- Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.
- Toy?

312
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:58,828
T-O-Y. Toy!

313
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:02,729
Excuse me, I-I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

314
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:06,993
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

475
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,079
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

476
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,596
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty
was pushed... by Woody!
- No!

477
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,707
- {All} What?
- Wait a minute.

478
00:26:33,812 --> 00:26:38,186
You-- You don't think I meant
to knock Buzz out the window,
do you? Potato Head?

479
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,139
- That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!
- { Gasps }

480
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:43,690
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.

481
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:45,867
Now, you, you
got to believe me.

482
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,938
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

483
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,660
Well, ye-- N--
I don't like confrontations!

484
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:55,079
Where is your honour, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

485
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:56,942
You don't deserve to-- Hey!

486
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:59,910
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your play time, could you, Woody?

487
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:04,329
Didn't want to face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favourite toy.

488
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:07,881
So you got rid of him.
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

489
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:10,255
You goanna knock me
outta the window too?

490
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:13,452

give him the chance.
- { Sergeant } There he is, men.

493
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,551

- No, no, no! W-W-Wait!
I can explain everything!

494
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:24,682
{Andy} Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've got to get Buzz.

where Buzz is?

499
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:42,119
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

Oh, okay.

501
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:52,205

I know I left him right there.

aren't working!

508

he'll take us back to the room;

and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

are responsible...

will return to its port of origin...

- Uh-huh.

to find a way to transport you home.

- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

you're a Space Ranger, pal.

does a toy like me have...

against a Buzz Light year

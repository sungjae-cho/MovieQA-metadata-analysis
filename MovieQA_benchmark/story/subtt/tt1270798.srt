1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000


2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000


3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,200


4
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,770
Mother, what are you...

5
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,170
I thought you were a burglar.

6
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,730
I didn't mean to scare you darling,
I was just getting a snack.

7
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,110
Go back to bed.

8
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,780
What's the matter?

9
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,010
Go on, back to bed.

10
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,340
I'll make you hot chocolate.

11
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,370
Who are you?

12
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,390
And what have you done with my mother?

13
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,270
<i>(Charles telepathically speaking)
**My  mother has never set foot
in this kitchen in her life.**</i>

14
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,990
<i>**And she certainly never made me
hot chocolate.**</i>

15
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,400
<i>**Unless you count ordering the maid to do it.**</i>

16
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,010
You're not scared of me?

17
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,220
I always believed I couldn't be the
only one in the world.

18
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,800
The only person who is...

19
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,560
...different.

20
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,520
And here you are.
Charles Xavier.

21
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,540
Raven.

22
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,920
You're hungry and alone...

23
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,450
Take whatever you want.

24
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,890
We've got lots of food,
you don't have to steal.

25
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,280
In fact...

26
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,100
...you never have to steal again.

27
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,680
Heterochromia.

28
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,990
A gentlemen would at least offer
to buy me a drink first.

29
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,420
Newman, a pint of bitter for me
and a brandy for the lady, please.

30
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,740
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

31
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,520
The name's Xavier,
Charles Xavier.

32
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,700
- How do you do...
- Amy.

33
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,690
Heterochromia is in reference to your eyes,

34
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,050
which I have to say are stunning.

35
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,430
One green, one blue. It's a mutation.

36
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,880
It's a very groovy mutation.

37
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,210
I've got news for you, Amy.
You are a mutant.

38
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,400
First you proposition a girl,
and then you call her deformed.

39
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,720
How is that seduction technique working for you?

40
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,270
I'll tell you in the morning.

41
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,950
No, seriously though, you mustnâ€™t knock it.

42
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,960
Mutation took some single celled organisms

43
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,050
to being the dominant form of
reproductive life on this planet.

44
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,150
Infinite forms of variation with each generation.

45
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,290
All through, mutation.

46
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,320
Then let's reclaim that word.

47
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,270
- Mutant and proud.
- Chin, chin, hey.

48
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,320
Hi, I guess I have to buy my own drink.

49
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,340
I'm sorry, one cola.

50
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,480
Charles here was just telling me that I'm

51
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,630
like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs.

52
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,960
Tiny bit sexier.

53
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,310
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Raven.

54
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,280
-Hi, Amy.
-And what do you study?

55
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,620
- Waitressing.
- Aah.

56
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,200
Oh look, you have heterochromia too!

57
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,420
- Say what?
- Look at her eye..

58
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,670
Right, Raven get your coat please.

59
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,210
Don't talk to me, you did
that on purpose.

60
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,540
- I did not!
- Yes you did!

61
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,030
Why would I do it on purpose?
You know I can't control it sometimes.

62
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,070
- When I'm stressed or tired..
- You seem to be doing a perfectly
good job right now.

63
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,480
"Mutant and proud"

64
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,930
Why is it always the pretty mutations
or invisible ones like yours.

65
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,540
If you're a freak, better hide.

66
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,470
You're being ridiculous!

67
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,810
Look, I don't mean to
sound like an old fart.

68
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,290
- Which you are.
- Sometimes, but we've talked about this, Raven.

69
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,730
A small slip up is one thing.
A big one does not bear thinking about.

70
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,300
"Mutant and proud"

71
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,470
"Mutant and proud"?

72
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,790
If only...

73
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,380
- Would you date me?
- Of course I would.

74
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,340
Any young man would be lucky to have you.

75
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,630
- You're stunning!
- Looking like this?

76
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,530
Like, you...what?

77
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,060
Blue?

78
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,430
- You're my oldest friend.
- I'm your only friend.

79
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,270
Thank you for that.

80
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,630
Well?

81
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,470
I'm incapable of thinking of you that way,
I feel responsible for you.

82
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,530
Anything else would just feel wrong.

83
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,300
- But what if you didn't know me?
- Unfortunately I do know you.

84
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,590
I don't know what's got into you lately?
You're awfully concerned with your looks.

85
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,150
I'm sleepy.
Will you read to me?

86
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,120
I can't, I have my thesis coming up, I have to study.

87
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,350
Well fine. Read that new thesis
it always sends me right off.

88
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,050
To Homo Neanderthalensis,
his  mutant cousin Homo Sapiens,

89
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,790
was an aberration.

90
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,740
Peaceful co-habitation, if ever it existed,

91
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,170
was short lived.

92
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,520
Records show, without exception, that the
arrival of the mutated human species

93
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,400
in any region was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin.

94
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,460
Another day at the office.

95
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,780
Is that Colonel Hendry?

96
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,290
- The NATO guy?
- Yeah.

97
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,770
Yes it is.

98
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,340
'Cause that's three mob bosses,

99
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,300
the Italian ambassador
and the CEO of Lockheed.

100
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,800
They can't all be communists.
This Hellfire club's gotta be something else.

101
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,360
Do you see that?
Hello, girls!

102
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,100
Wow, very nice.

103
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,580
Wha...what are you doing?

104
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,250
Using some equipment the CIA didn't give me.

105
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,510
Stay put.

106
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,150
- Colonel Hendry?
- Yes, ma'am.

107
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,180
Emma Frost,
Sebastian Shaw's associate.

108
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,310
And where is Mr. Shaw?

109
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,710
We're having a party and here's the entertainment.
Come with me.

110
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,790
Hello beautiful, how are you?

111
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,100
Hey baby, you want to find a quiet place?

112
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,490
I'm so sorry.
I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.

113
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,980
Excuse me.

114
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,840
- Are you sure we can't get you a refill, Bob?
- No.

115
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,260
So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position
Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

116
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,120
- I expect you'll reconsider.
- We've had this conversation.

117
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,940
You put our nukes in Turkey,
or anywhere that close to Russia,

118
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,510
and you're looking at war.
Nuclear war.

119
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,680
I don't ask for favors, Colonel.
I express my expectations.

120
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:38,400
So, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.

121
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,020
The only thing I will reconsider
is having another glass of that delicious champagne.

122
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,620
What the hell did you put in my drink?

123
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,660
<i>**You're thinking of running, hiding?
We'd find you, Hendry.**</i>

124
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,690
<i>**There's not a fortress in the world
that can keep us out.**</i>

125
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,760
Magnificent, isn't she, Bob?

126
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,110
Genetic mutation, the evolution of the human genome.

127
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,010
Where's Azazel?

128
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,770
Ah, we don't want the Colonel to be late.

129
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,970
Come here.

130
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,340
Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.

131
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,680
We ever decide to fire them,

132
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,230
the Russian early warning system won't
even have time to kick in.

133
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,810
This better be important, MacTaggert

134
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

135
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,430
You smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

136
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,460
Colonel Hendry was there.
He was there McCone, in the Hellfire club.

137
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,020
Colonel Hendry?

138
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,800
I agree with you, General.
I've reconsidered my position.

139
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,970
And I now believe that we should put
Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.

140
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,080
Colonel Hendry is here.

141
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,770
So, unless he magically traveled
3,000 miles in the last ten minutes,

142
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,620
Listen to me, I suggest that you stop
wasting my time.

143
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,420
Looks like Hendry wants to start
World War III.

144
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,240
I have better things to deal with right now, MacTaggert.

145
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,730
Sir, I...!

146
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,490
Have you lost your mind?

147
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
So, now what?

148
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,800
We find an expert on genetic mutation.

149
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,570
<i>Professor of genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.</i>

150
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,190
So, how does it feel to be a professor?

151
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,570
Oh, don't call me that. You don't get to be called a
Professor until you actually have a teaching position.

152
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,080
- I know, but it suits you.
- No, don't say that, do say "Lets go have a drink" tho.

153
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,550
- Let's go have a drink.
- Wonderful!

154
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,330
Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.

155
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm looking for my creator.

156
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,710
Drink, drink, drink!

157
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,720
Oh, I'm so proud of  you.

158
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,540
I need another drink and you
need another cola.

159
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,020
- Congratulations, Professor!
- Thank you very much, it's much harder than it looks, actually..

160
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,080
- No, on your presentation.
- Oh, you were at my presentation?

161
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,900
How nice of you, thank you very much.

162
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,590
- Moira MacTaggert.
- Charles Xavier.

163
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,330
Do you have a minute?

164
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,680
For a pretty little beam with a
mutated MCR-1 gene, I have five.

165
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,220
I say MCR-1, you would say
auburn hair.

166
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,840
It's a mutation, it's a very groovy mutation.

167
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,330
Mutation, right, took us from single
celled organisms,

168
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,180
to the dominant form...

169
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,280
You know what, this routine may go over great
with the co-eds, but I'm here on business.

170
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,930
- What?
- I really need your help.

171
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,910
All right.

172
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,230
The kind of mutations that you were
talking about in your thesis

173
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,720
I need to know if they may have already happened.

174
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,810
In people alive today.

175
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,900
Professor?

176
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,380
I think we should just talk when you're sober.

177
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,820
Do you have any time tomorrow?

178
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,090
Something tells me you already know
the answer to your question.

179
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,360
This is very important to me.

180
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,960
And if I can help you, I will do my utmost.

181
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,640
Thank you.

182
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,630
- Still drinking champagne, Bob?
- I will pass.

183
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,210
Okay, well so much for the pleasantries.

184
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,040
I was wondering, who you told
about our little arrangement?

185
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,660
No one.

186
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,190
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.

187
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,190
Well I guess we're done here.
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

188
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,640
Well I knew better than to trust you.

189
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,710
Now you let me walk out of here
with my money.

190
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,600
Or I will pull this pin and we all die.

191
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,320
Go ahead, pull it.

192
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,920
I'll do it, I swear to god.

193
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,690
No you won't.

194
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,870
But I will.

195
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,680
You're one of them?

196
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,460
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
You want to guess what I can do?

197
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,350
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

198
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,920
That's the boring part.

199
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,540
The fun stuff is what I can do with it
once I got it.

200
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,800
The advent of the nuclear age
may have accelerated the mutation process.

201
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,540
Individuals with extraordinary abilities may
already be among us.

202
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,330
Thank you very much.

203
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,970
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist,

204
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,420
is going to make me believe in sparkly dames
and vanishing men?

205
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,180
You just bought yourself a one way ticket
back to the typing pool.

206
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,830
This meeting is over.

207
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,280
Uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.

208
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,640
I didn't really expect you to believe me.

209
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,470
Given that all you could think about during my presentation

210
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,070
was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.

211
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,880
It's apple pecan.

212
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,400
I haven't been entirely honest with you, luv, I'm sorry.

213
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,290
You see, one of the many spectacular things my
mutation allows me to do

214
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,200
is that I can read your  mind.

215
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,180
I've seen this before in a magic show.

216
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,960
Are you gonna ask us to think of a number
between one and ten now?

217
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,670
No, agent Stryker.

218
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,030
Although I could ask  you about your son William who
you were thinking about,

219
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,440
which is very nice, but I think
I'd rather ask you about the Jupiter...

220
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,070
...missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.

221
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,460
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddamn spy!

222
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,420
I did not, I would never have brought him here!

223
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,310
How's that for a magic trick?

224
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,560
Best I've ever seen.

225
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,550
I want them out of here.

226
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,730
And locked down until I can figure out
what to do.

227
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,780
My facility is off site. I'll take them.

228
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,120
I can't believe this.

229
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,580
You'd think the director of the CIA
would have a little more composure.

230
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,020
We should be going after Shaw right now, but...

231
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,060
...instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.

232
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,340
What are we doing to do, Lavene?

233
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,800
Lavene?
Lavene, what's wrong with you?

234
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,780
<i>**Absolutely nothing, I've just frozen him for a
moment because I'd like to talk to you.**</i>

235
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,020
<i>**It's good, isn't it?**</i>

236
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,810
<i>**I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are,**</i>

237
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,800
<i>**...and if you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.**</i>

238
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,640
I've always known that there were people like
you out there.

239
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,120
I've been the laughing stock of this agency
for years but I knew it.

240
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,240
You're going to love my facility.

241
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,060
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?

242
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,000
Agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw,

243
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,330
and if we don't move now apparently
we're going to lose him.

244
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,170
What?

245
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,320
Not only can he read minds,
he can communicate with them as well.

246
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,150
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.

247
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,100
- Yes, we did.
- That is incredible!

248
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,480
But I cannot take you anywhere else,
without permission from upstairs.

249
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,650
- Would you like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

250
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,280
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

251
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,900
Herr Doctor...

252
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,680
He's here to kill you.

253
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,770
Emma...

254
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,650
We don't harm our own kind.

255
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,620
Ah, now it's a party.

256
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:20,070
This is the US Coast Guard.
Do not attempt to move your vessel.

257
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,930
Stay where you are.

258
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,130
They have a telepath.

259
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,220
I've lost Shaw!

260
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,180
I've lost, I've lost Shaw.

261
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,970
There's, there's something blocking me.
This has never happened to me before.

262
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,710
I think there's someone like
me on that ship.

263
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,530
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

264
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,530
This is incredible, I can actually feel
her inside my mind.

265
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,390
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm
going to be much help to you tonight.

266
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,450
You're on your own.

267
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,090
- Oh my god.
- Jesus.

268
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,420
Get inside.

269
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,680
Stop, stop, stop!

270
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,260
Charles!
You okay?

271
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,820
There's someone else out there.

272
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,840
There!

273
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,770
Time to go.

274
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,060
Let go!

275
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,290
Better let it go!

276
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,120
You've got help him...there's
someone in the water, help him!

277
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,520
Let it go!
You have to let it go!

278
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,800
<i>**You can't, you'll drown.
You have to let go.**</i>

279
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,510
<i>**I know what this means to you
but you're going to die.**</i>

280
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,660
<i>**Please, Erik, calm your mind.**</i>

281
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,100
Get off of me, get off!

282
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,320
Calm down, please.
We're here!

283
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,380
- Who are you?
-  My name's Charles Xavier.

284
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,300
You were in my head.

285
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,860
How did you do that?

286
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,220
You have your tricks, I have mine.

287
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,650
I'm like you, just calm your mind.

288
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,630
- I thought I was alone.
- You're not alone.

289
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,260
Erik, you're not alone.

290
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,730
Welcome to my facility.

291
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,040
My mission has been to investigate the

292
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,500
application of paranormal powers
for military defense.

293
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,840
Or offense.

294
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,110
This guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever
you want to call him.

295
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,860
He's working with the Russians.

296
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,470
We might need your help to stop them.

297
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,430
Marvelous.

298
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,150
So we're to be the CIA's new
mutant division, yes?

299
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,450
Something like that.

300
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,050
It's a supersonic. The most advanced plane
ever built.

301
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,240
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.

302
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,050
Hank, these are the special new recruits I
was telling you about.

303
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,100
This is Hank McCoy,

304
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,110
one of our most talented young researchers.

305
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,660
How wonderful, another mutant.
Already here.

306
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,360
- Why didn't you say?
- Say what?

307
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,100
Because you don't know.

308
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,840
I am so, so terribly sorry.

309
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,510
Hank?

310
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,520
You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

311
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,290
So  your mutation's what?
You're super smart?

312
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,500
I'll say, Hank here graduated Harvard at the age of fifteen.

313
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,290
I wish that's all it was.

314
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,860
You're among friends now, Hank.
You can show off.

315
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,390
Splendid.

316
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,010
- Sorry.
- Yes, yes.

317
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,870
- You're amazing.
- Really?

318
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,280
The presence of U.S. missiles in Turkey
represents an unprecedented threat

319
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,990
to the people of the Soviet Union.

320
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,620
warned Russian Foreign Minister Gromeko earlier today.

321
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:07,890
But he was quick to insist the Russians
would not be the first to initiate any military action.

322
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,240
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as
we get to Russia.

323
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,850
- Unless the CIA find us first.
- I'll take care of them too.

324
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,900
If that telepath gets inside your head,
he won't be as much fun as I am.

325
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,190
Already in hand, my love.

326
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,870
The Russians...

327
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,590
...made me this.

328
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,350
So, what am I thinking?

329
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,820
I don't know.

330
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,250
I was thinking that you are the most exquisite
thing I've ever seen in my life.

331
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,740
And that this needs ice.

332
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,750
Fetch me some.

333
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,160
There's a good girl.

334
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,790
I, I promised myself I'd find a cure
ever since I was a little boy.

335
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,500
You have no idea what I'd give to feel...

336
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,740
- ...normal.
- Normal.

337
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,290
Charles has never understood.

338
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,800
He's different, but he's never had to hide.

339
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,540
Hank this serum that you're making,
it doesn't affect abilities, right?

340
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,230
Just appearance.
Normalizes it.

341
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,490
Yeah.

342
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,940
Do you think it would work on me?

343
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,470
I can look into it, if you'd like.

344
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,950
That's the least I can do after asking you to
come down here to such a weird request.

345
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,810
I have to admit,

346
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,460
usually when guys ask me out they're
not after my blood.

347
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,770
S..sorry, I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...I was excited.

348
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,950
You know, the nature of your mutation.

349
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,140
If any genes hold the key to changing appearance,
it's yours.

350
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,510
Hank, you aren't being forward,
that's kinda what I meant.

351
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,270
- No, but I'm just sorry if you thought I was.
- And I'm sorry that you weren't.

352
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,070
Go ahead, take the blood.

353
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,170
Sorry, did I hurt you?

354
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,650
Kinky!

355
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,060
By the way, if I looked like you,
I wouldn't change a thing.

356
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,520
What I know about you, I'm surprised
you've managed to stay this long.

357
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,380
- What do you know about me?
- Everything.

358
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,550
Then you know to stay out of my head.

359
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,050
I'm sorry Erik, but I've seen what
Shaw did to you.

360
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,810
I felt your agony.

361
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,710
I can help you.

362
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,410
I don't need your help.

363
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,540
Don't kid yourself. You needed my help last night.

364
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,730
It's not just me you're walking away from.

365
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,410
Here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself.

366
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,710
I won't stop you leaving. I could.

367
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,130
But I won't.

368
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,480
Shaw's got friends.

369
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,740
You could do with some.

370
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,470
Hank turned that radar installation into
a transmitter.

371
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,610
It's designed to amplify brain waves,

372
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,040
...so it could enhance your telepathic powers.

373
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,530
Help us find other mutants for our division.

374
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,560
What if they don't want to be found by you?

375
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,100
Erik.

376
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,020
You decided to stay.

377
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,060
If a new species is being discovered,
it should be by its own kind.

378
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,910
Charles and I find the mutants,
no suits.

379
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,650
First of all, that's my machine out there.

380
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,970
Second of all, and much more importantly,

381
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,590
this is Charles' decision.

382
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,440
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved.
Isn't that right?

383
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,050
No, I'm sorry but, I'm with Erik.

384
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,490
We'll find them alone.

385
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,200
What if I say no?

386
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,080
Then good luck using your installation without me.

387
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,230
I call it Cerebro.

388
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,730
- Isn't that Spanish for "brain"?
- Yes.

389
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,560
Okay so, the electrodes connect
Charles to the transmitter on the roof.

390
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,370
When he picks up a mutant

391
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,510
his brain sends a signal through a relay

392
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,080
and then the co-ordinates of their
location are printed out here.

393
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,250
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

394
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,170
- What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.
- Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

395
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,660
I've been a lab rat, I know one when I see one.

396
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,730
Okay, great...

397
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,810
- Are you sure we can't shave your head?
- Don't touch my hair.

398
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,530
It's working!

399
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,550
With that Daddy-O, you get a private dance.

400
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,430
You cats know it's double for both, right?

401
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,460
No, that won't be necessary.
although I'm sure we...

402
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,020
We were thinking, we'll show you ours,

403
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,990
...if you show us yours.

404
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,340
Baby, that is not the way it works around here.

405
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,750
- More tea, Vicar?
- Don't mind if I do.

406
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,510
My turn.

407
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,050
How would you like a job where you
get to keep the clothes on?

408
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,950
- Where to fellas?
- Richmond, Virginia.

409
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,920
Right, so you want the airport, the station, what?

410
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,810
No, we were rather hoping you would
take us all the way.

411
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,480
That's a six hour drive.

412
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,210
That will give us plenty of time to talk.

413
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,280
What the hell does the government want
with a guy like Alex Summers?

414
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,500
I hope you're not planning on putting him with others.

415
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,110
First guy I ever met who actually
prefers solitary confinement.

416
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,910
- Crazy, huh?
- What?

417
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,820
You like fish, I like fish too.

418
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,830
Maybe we should bite
some time and talk about it.

419
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,070
I'd rather go out with the fish.

420
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,420
These fish?

421
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,680
- Excuse me I'm Erik Lensher.
- Charles Xavier.

422
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,290
Go fuck yourself.

423
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,740
- There's nothing on radar?
- Nothing.

424
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,410
- Sonar?
- Niet.

425
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,150
Then we have a problem.

426
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,160
Beautiful, isn't it?

427
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,300
The reason we exist.
We are the children of the atom, my love.

428
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,030
We have a situation.

429
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,970
The telepath...

430
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,050
I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance.

431
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,250
It's like his reach is...

432
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,340
...amplified.

433
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,430
They're recruiting.

434
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,940
You go on to Russia,
I'll handle him.

435
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,200
I can't stop thinking about the others out there.

436
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,530
All those minds that I touched.

437
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:35,740
I could feel them: their isolation, their hopes,
their ambitions.

438
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,980
I tell you, it's the start of something
incredible, Erik.

439
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,010
- We can help them.
- Can we?

440
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,000
Identification, that's how it starts.

441
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,990
Then ends with being rounded up,
experimented on, eliminated.

442
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,660
Yeah, not this time.

443
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,460
We have common enemies, Shaw and the Russians.
They need us.

444
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,840
For now.

445
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,880
We should think of code names.

446
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,090
We're government agents now,
we should have secret code names.

447
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,100
- I want to be called, Mystique.
- Damn, I wanted to be called Mystique.

448
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,100
- Well tough, I called it.

449
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,690
And I'm way more mysterious than you.

450
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,280
- Darwin, what about you?
- Well, uh, Darwin's already a nickname.

451
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,250
And you know, sort of fits.
Adapt to survive and all.

452
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,040
Check this out.

453
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,010
- Thank you, thank you.
- Bravo, bravo.

454
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,340
- What about you?
- I'm going to be...

455
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,320
...Banshee.

456
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,040
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

457
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,770
You might want to cover your ears.

458
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,830
Your turn.

459
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,470
My stage name is Angel.
Kind of fits.

460
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,880
- You can fly?
-  Ah, hah. And uh...

461
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,970
- What's your name?
- How about Big Foot?

462
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,460
Well you know what they say
about guys with big feet?

463
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,890
And uh, yours are kind of small.

464
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,520
Okay, now.

465
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,330
Alex, what is your gift?
What can you do?

466
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,130
Uh, it's not um, I just can't do it.

467
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,680
- I can't do it in here.
- Can you do it out there?

468
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,600
- Why don't you just do it out there.
- Come on.
-Come on, Alex.

469
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:52,560
Alex! Alex!

470
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,160
That's the spirit.

471
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,790
Get down when I tell you.

472
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,480
Get back.

473
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,480
Get back!

474
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,030
Whatever...

475
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,320
We've got intel that Shaw is meeting with
the Russian defense chief in Moscow.

476
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,130
So go ahead, say it.

477
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,780
I'm not here to say "I told you so",
you know why I'm here.

478
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring
along your mutants.

479
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,150
Fight fire with fire.

480
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,790
Makes sense.

481
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,760
Wait, you're okay with this?

482
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,550
Sending in a bunch of untrained
unauthorized freaks?

483
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:50,510
These "freaks" are dedicated hard working people.

484
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,320
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

485
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,320
I'm telling you these kids
are not ready for Shaw.

486
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,170
I think they're going to surprise you.
They are an exceptional bunch of young people.

487
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,340
What the hell?

488
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,750
Harder!

489
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,660
What are  you doing?

490
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,540
- Who destroyed the statue?
- It was, Alex.

491
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,540
No Havok! We have to call him, Havok.
That's his name now.

492
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,660
And we were thinking, you should be, Professor X

493
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:36,390
And you should be Magneto.

494
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,060
Exceptional.

495
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,010
I expect more from you.

496
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,020
We got a problem.

497
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,550
- What?
- I'm so sorry, this wasn't on the map.

498
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,260
No matter what happens, act normally.

499
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,750
I'll take care of this, all right?

500
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,400
Now listen to me..

501
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:25,720
To our farm.

502
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,200
Oh, easy, easy.
Take it easy, chaps.

503
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,200
- Where's Shaw?
- I don't know.

504
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,920
If she's the telepath, and I read her, she'll know we're here.

505
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,060
Let me try something else.

506
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,590
Shaw sends his apologies, but
he's indisposed.

507
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,070
He asked me to come in his place.

508
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:56,080
But between you and I honey,
I'm a lot better company.

509
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,200
Please come in.

510
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,800
He's not coming.

511
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,750
- So, what now, boss?
- Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.

512
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,330
- Mission aborted
- The hell it is.

513
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,750
- Erik.
-She's his right hand woman.

514
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,160
That's good enough for me.

515
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,760
The CIA invading the home of a senior
Soviet official.

516
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:20,350
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not CIA.

517
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,280
Erik!

518
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,190
So you must be busy planning your next move,

519
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,620
but with the Americans refusing to remove
their missiles from Turkey.

520
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,040
You know I can't talk about those things, Miss Frost.

521
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,820
Emma.

522
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,520
And don't worry, you don't have to say a word.

523
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,100
He's going to start world war III single handed.

524
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,030
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

525
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,100
- We're moving out.
- You can't.

526
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,270
I'm sorry, I can't leave him.

527
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,020
For god's sake, Erik...

528
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,340
Be calm.

529
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,920
You're beautiful, so beautiful...yes.

530
00:55:58,490 --> 00:55:59,890
Pathetic.

531
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,740
Nice trick.

532
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,190
Who are you?

533
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,950
Go to sleep.

534
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,250
You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.

535
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,900
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

536
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,730
So then you can just tell us.

537
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,630
Where is Shaw?

538
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,900
Erik.

539
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,390
Erik, that's enough.

540
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,370
Erik, that's enough!

541
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,820
All yours.

542
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,090
She won't be shifting into diamond form again.

543
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,250
But if she does, just give her a gentle tap.

544
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,820
<i>We are the children of the atom.</i>

545
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,750
<i>Radiation gave birth to mutants.</i>

546
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,910
<i>What will kill the humans,
will only make us stronger.</i>

547
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,860
Beautiful, isn't it?

548
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,990
This is worse that we previously imagined.

549
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,820
We're taking you with us.

550
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,490
- CIA will want to question you themselves.
- I doubt it.

551
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,080
They have bigger things to worry about right now.

552
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,860
Whoa, all right.

553
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:43,460
- Jesus, man you are killing me.
- Don't beat yourself up, we got a lot of spare time.

554
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,040
Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town.

555
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,610
Hey come on honey, give us a little, uh...

556
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,890
No? Come on, let's see the foot.
There it is, come on Bigfoot let's go.

557
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,840
Hey, hey come on, hey.

558
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:06,110
They're just guys being stupid.

559
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,600
Guys being stupid I can handle.
Okay, I've handled that my whole life.

560
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,030
But I'd rather have a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off,

561
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,420
than the way these ones stare at me.

562
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,610
At us.

563
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,460
What was that?

564
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,310
I don't know, but something doesn't feel right.

565
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:42,120
- No news of Shaw?
- Not a peep, nothing through that back channel.

566
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,050
What is that?

567
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,560
We have an intruder on the main atrium.

568
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,320
- Where are the mutants?
- You take another step, I'm going to put you down.

569
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,960
Of course you will, but where do I find
the more evolved people?

570
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:22,710
Send back-up now!

571
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,260
Get back, get back, do not leave that room.
We're under attack.

572
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,530
- Look out!
- Shoot it, shoot it!

573
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:44,840
Where are the mutants?

574
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,000
Put that man down or we will open fire.

575
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,950
Stay here my ass.
Let's go!

576
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,700
- Get back!
- We can help, we can help!

577
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,050
Wait, wait, you want the mutants?
They're right through that door.

578
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,450
Just let us normal people go.

579
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,800
We're no threa...

580
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:34,790
Where's the telepath?

581
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,230
- Not here.
- Too bad.

582
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,660
Well, at least I can take this silly thing off.

583
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:44,770
Good evening
My name's Sebastian Shaw.

584
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,130
And I am not here to hurt you.

585
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,220
Freeze!

586
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:51,860
Azazel...

587
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,210
My friends, there's a revolution coming.

588
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:01,810
When mankind discovers who we are,
what we can do

589
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:03,630
each of us will face a choice:

590
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,770
Be enslaved, or rise up to rule.

591
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,160
Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us,

592
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,510
then by definition you are against us.

593
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:22,080
So, you can stay, and fight for the
people who hate, and fear you.

594
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,930
Or you can join me,
and live like kings.

595
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,170
And Queens.

596
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,100
- Angel?
- Are you kidding me?

597
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,920
Come on, we don't belong here.

598
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,640
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

599
01:03:58,690 --> 01:03:59,980
We have to do something.

600
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,060
Stop. I'm coming with you.

601
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,780
Good choice.

602
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,370
So tell me about your mutation.

603
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,610
Well, I adapt to survive.

604
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:34,990
- So I guess I'm coming with you.
- I like that.

605
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,710
- Alex,...............do it!
- Get down!

606
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,620
Protecting your fellow mutants?

607
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,890
It's a noble gesture.
Feels good.

608
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,400
Adapt to this.

609
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,000
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

610
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,240
You will make this happen.

611
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,710
Let's see what KGB think about this.

612
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,420
Raven.

613
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,380
We've made arrangements for you to
be taken home immediately.

614
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:23,950
- We're not going home.
- What?

615
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,730
- He's not going back to prison.
- They killed Darwin.

616
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,200
All the more reason for you to leave.

617
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,290
This is over.

618
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:34,670
Darwin's dead, Charles.
And we can't even bury him.

619
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:38,620
We can avenge him.

620
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,260
Erik, word please.

621
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,640
- They're just kids.
- No, they were kids.

622
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,240
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

623
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,130
We'll have to train.
All of us.

624
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,710
- Yes?
- Yeah.

625
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,810
But we can't stay here.

626
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:08,600
Even if they reopen the department,
it's not safe.

627
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:11,450
We've got nowhere to go.

628
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,250
Yes, we do.

629
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,590
The law says we've got to turn her over.

630
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,830
The law applies to human beings.

631
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,000
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're too dangerous.

632
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:26,820
Times like this, security is more
important than liberty.

633
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:31,820
- There's a war coming, John.
- Yes, but a war with who?

634
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:46,610
Excellent question.

635
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,350
Though I won't call it a war exactly.

636
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,150
That suggests both sides stand an
equal chance of winning.

637
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,860
The Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba.

638
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,290
We have a week before their ship hits the coast.

639
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:17,510
Our fleet can be on this line,
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

640
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:22,940
If that ship crosses the line, they will have
declared war against the United States.

641
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:26,740
We will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response.

642
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:28,910
Do we agree?

643
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,070
Dispatch the Seventh Fleet.

644
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,710
- This is yours?
- No, it's ours.

645
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:50,630
Honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.

646
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,600
Living in such hardship.

647
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,370
Well it was a hardship softened by me.

648
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:00,970
Come on, time for the tour.

649
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,890
<i>President Kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation.</i>

650
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,610
<i>Setting up a blockade of all missiles,
bound for Cuba.</i>

651
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:57,630
<i>The Soviet Union reacted by terming it
as step along the road to unleashing a thermonuclear war.</i>

652
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:10,170
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

653
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:11,850
All right.

654
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:20,900
No, no I can't I'm sorry.

655
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:22,240
I can't shoot anybody point blank,

656
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,180
let alone my friend.

657
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,010
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.

658
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,450
You're always telling me I should push myself.

659
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,770
If you know you can deflect it, then
you're not challenging yourself.

660
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,950
What ever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

661
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:35,700
What, I can't.

662
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,210
Something that big, I need the situation, the anger.

663
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,750
No, the anger's not enough.

664
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:43,180
It's gotten the job done all this time.

665
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:44,920
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.

666
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:47,190
Hey, come here.

667
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,240
Let's try something a little more challenging.

668
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,420
My stepfather took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously.

669
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,560
This way.

670
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:57,730
That's why he had this bunker built down here.

671
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:00,200
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.

672
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:01,800
You don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?

673
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,500
No, he had this place built to
withstand a nuclear bomb.

674
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:06,110
I think it can handle you, Alex.

675
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,390
You know when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

676
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:12,690
That's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

677
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:15,810
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's part of your training.

678
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:21,850
What you're doing is incredible.

679
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,690
You're hitting a pitch with sound waves that's at
the same resonant frequency of the glass.

680
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:25,750
That's why it shatters.

681
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,250
This it's like any other muscle in the body.

682
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,260
You can control it.

683
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,480
"In each of us, two natures are at war."

684
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,310
Robert Louis Stevenson,
"Jekyll and Hyde".

685
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,320
Top marks.

686
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,590
Still it wasn't really about good
and evil tho, was it, Hank?

687
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:41,680
It was about man's animal nature,
and his struggle to control it.

688
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,810
To conform.

689
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:45,020
It is that struggle which is holding you back.

690
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,820
Jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.

691
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,190
You are too.

692
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,980
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

693
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,250
- Of course, should I shut the door?
- Yeah.

694
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,640
Whenever you're ready.

695
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,130
Oh my god.

696
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,670
I will teach you to control this, Alex.

697
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,280
You're sure that this will work.

698
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:20,990
Anything is possible. I based the design...

699
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,220
Hank, stop talking.
Come on.

700
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,030
Now remember, scream as hard as you can.

701
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,880
You need the sound waves to be supersonic.

702
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:28,760
Catch them at the right angle,
and they should carry you.

703
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:32,500
"They should carry me."
That's reassuring.

704
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,180
Good luck.

705
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,130
And don't forget to scream.

706
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,770
If you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

707
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:53,920
On your marks, get set...GO!

708
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:09,960
Oh, congratulations my friend.

709
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,110
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

710
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,150
Impressive, Hank.

711
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,490
Feet like those, all you need is a red nose.

712
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,750
Right, Bozo?

713
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,970
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex

714
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,510
Come on, Hank.

715
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,980
If you're using half the concentration to look normal

716
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,870
then you're only half paying attention to
whatever else you do.

717
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:42,840
Just pointing out something that could save your life.

718
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:49,010
You want society to accept you

719
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:51,660
but you can't even accept yourself.

720
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,000
Sexy.

721
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,020
This is just the prototype.

722
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,320
The real one will look considerably better,
it'll be a whole suit.

723
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:08,390
See these sensors measure your energy output,
this panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed.

724
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:10,700
All right try hitting the one in the middle,
just the one in the middle, mind.

725
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,290
Good luck.

726
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,960
You gotta see this. Your genes are
extraordinary, you know that?

727
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,840
Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.

728
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:28,950
When you're forty you will still
have the leucocytes of a teenager.

729
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,780
You have the most incredible cellular
structure I've ever seen.

730
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:39,710
You truly believe I'll fly this time?

731
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,190
Unreservedly.

732
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,760
- I trust you.
- I'm touched.

733
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,290
- I don't trust him.
- Say nothing.

734
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:46,600
I'm going to die!

735
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,300
All right, look we're not going to make you do anything
that your not so...

736
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,490
Here, let me help him.

737
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,350
Erik!

738
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,380
Whaoooo!

739
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,150
Wahhh hooo!

740
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,720
What?

741
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,600
You know you were thinking the same.

742
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:20,960
Wonderful work Hank, thank you very much.
All right Alex, I want you to hit the X.

743
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,390
And try not to hit me, there's a good chap.

744
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,710
- You're serious?
- I'm very serious.

745
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:28,980
I have complete and utter faith in you.

746
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,890
- Am I still a Bozo?
- Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.

747
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,280
But nice job.

748
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,130
See that?

749
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,310
Try turning it to face us.

750
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:17,340
You know, I believe the true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

751
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:21,050
Would you mind, if I...?

752
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,000
What did you just do to me?

753
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:59,730
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

754
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,900
It's a very beautiful memory Erik, thank you.

755
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,760
I didn't know I still had that.

756
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:09,940
There's so much more to you than you know.

757
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:15,470
Not just pain and anger.
There's good too, I felt it.

758
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,430
And when you can access all that

759
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,290
you'll possess a power no one can match.

760
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:23,780
Not even me.

761
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,640
So, come on. Try again.

762
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:07,660
- Hey!
-Well done.

763
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,940
The President is about to make his address.

764
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:15,940
<i>It shall be the policy of this nation
to regard any nuclear missile,</i>

765
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:19,250
<i>...crossing the embargo line, that surrounds Cuba</i>

766
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:23,140
<i>as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States</i>

767
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:27,500
<i>requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the Soviet Union.</i>

768
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,500
- Thatâ€™s' where we're going to find Shaw.
- How do you know?

769
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:33,140
Two super powers facing off, and
he wants to start World War III.

770
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,390
He won't leave anything to chance.

771
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,360
So much for diplomacy.
I suggest you all get a good night sleep.

772
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:42,040
<i>...ultimately leads to war.</i>

773
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:46,270
<i>Tensions mount as the Soviet Missile
ship nears Cuba.</i>

774
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:50,970
<i>All diplomatic efforts to avert
Nuclear war have thus far failed.</i>

775
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,550
<i>As the American people ready themselves,
for the likelihood of an atomic attack</i>

776
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:58,180
<i>there are widespread reports of panic buying.</i>

777
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,460
<i>Supermarkets cleared.</i>

778
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,230
<i>As shelters unused since the second world war,</i>

779
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,550
<i>are stocked for what may lie ahead.</i>

780
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:09,890
<i>In all its history, America has never
faced a greater threat.</i>

781
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:13,960
The world is primed for war.
And there's no one to stop me.

782
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,340
Come in.

783
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:22,130
Hey.

784
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:24,390
Have a surprise for you.

785
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:36,250
I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.

786
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:38,540
The serum works like an antibiotic.

787
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,280
Attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.

788
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,830
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

789
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,630
Do you still want to do this?

790
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,730
Should we have to hide?

791
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:54,200
You already do.

792
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:57,530
You're hiding right now,
like I have my whole life.

793
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,060
I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.

794
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,740
- I just want to look...
- ...normal.

795
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:03,970
Yeah.

796
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,420
Hank, don't.

797
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,190
You're beautiful, Hank.
Everything you are, you're perfect.

798
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:23,800
Look at all of us. Look at
all we've achieved this week.

799
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,720
All we will achieve.

800
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:31,960
We are different. But we shouldn't
be trying to fit into society.

801
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,350
Society should aspire to be more like us.

802
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,850
Mutant, and proud.

803
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:48,440
It behooves me to tell you,
but even if we save the world tomorrow

804
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:50,710
and mutants are accepted into society,

805
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,220
my feet and your natural blue form

806
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,920
will never be deemed beautiful.

807
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,680
You look beautiful now.

808
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:08,470
We need this cure.

809
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:39,160
Cuba, Russia, America... makes no difference.

810
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,600
Shaw's declared war on mankind,
on all of us.

811
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:48,800
- He has to be stopped.
- I'm not going to stop Shaw, I'm going to kill him.

812
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,640
Do you have it in you to allow that?

813
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:02,120
You've known all along
why I was here, Charles.

814
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:03,790
But things have changed.

815
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,770
What started as a covert mission,

816
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,880
...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.

817
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,010
Shaw, us... they won't differentiate.

818
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,920
They'll fear us, and that
fear will turn to hatred.

819
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,410
Not if we stop a war.
Not if we can prevent Shaw.

820
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:21,360
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

821
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,640
Would they do the same for us?

822
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,340
We have it in us to be the better men.

823
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,060
We already are.

824
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:27,980
We're the next stage of human evolution.

825
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:29,630
- You said it yourself.
- Not do.

826
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,000
Are you really so naive

827
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,560
as to think they won't battle their own extinction?

828
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:38,270
- Or is it arrogance?
- I'm sorry?

829
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:41,240
After tomorrow they're going to turn on us

830
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:44,490
and you're blind to it, because you
believe they're all like Moira.

831
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,520
And you believe they're all like Shaw.

832
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:51,670
Listen to me, very carefully my friend.

833
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,820
Killing Shaw will not bring you peace.

834
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,300
Peace was never an option.

835
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,060
No.

836
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:48,530
No.

837
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,060
Well...

838
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,640
This is a surprise.

839
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:22,270
The nice kind?

840
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,550
Get out, Raven. I wanna go to bed.

841
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:29,030
Maybe in a few years.

842
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:34,880
How about now?

843
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,730
I prefer the real Raven.

844
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,900
I said the real Raven.

845
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,870
Perfection.

846
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,230
- Could you pass me my robe?
- You don't have to hide.

847
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:14,280
Have you ever looked at a tiger
and thought you ought to cover it up?

848
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,280
No, but...

849
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,180
You're an exquisite creature, Raven.

850
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,210
All your life the world has tried to tame you.

851
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:26,590
It's time for you to be free.

852
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,300
You know sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like

853
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,200
if you hadn't found me here that night.

854
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,900
Say what? E..gah...ah.

855
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:55,570
For gods sake, Raven!

856
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:58,400
Where are you clothes?
Pu...put some, put some clothes on.

857
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,270
That's not what you said when you first saw me.

858
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:03,430
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

859
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:05,980
Raven, I don't know what's got into you lately.

860
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,780
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

861
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:13,290
Hank tells me he's found the
answer to your cosmetic problem.

862
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,820
You going to tell me what's the matter
or will I have to read your mind?

863
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,600
You promised me you would never do that.

864
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:24,130
Until recently, I never had to use my power
to know what you were thinking, Raven.

865
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:27,800
You know Charles, I used to think
it was gonna be you and me against the world.

866
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:31,500
But no matter how bad the world gets,
you don't want to be against it, do you?

867
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,580
You want to be a part of it.

868
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,030
What the hell happened here?

869
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,550
Hank has been busy.

870
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:06,390
Do we really have to wear these?

871
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,800
As none of us has mutated to endure extreme G force,

872
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,850
or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up.

873
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:37,780
Where's Hank?

874
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:40,990
I'm here.

875
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,300
Hank?

876
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:01,250
It didn't attack the cells.
It enhanced them.

877
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:04,730
It didn't work.

878
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:06,880
Yes it did, Hank.

879
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:10,860
Don't you see?
This is who you were meant to be.

880
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,430
This is you.

881
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,480
No more hiding.

882
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,330
Never looked better, man.

883
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:20,130
Hank!

884
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:23,560
Don't mock me.

885
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,420
Hank, put him down immediately, please.

886
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,880
Hank...HANK!

887
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,030
I wasn't.

888
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:33,280
Even I got to admit, you look pretty bad ass.

889
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:36,590
I think I got a new name for you: Beast.

890
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,020
- You sure you can fly this thing?
- Of course I can, I designed it.

891
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:55,980
Status of the cargo ship?

892
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,600
Bearing 1-8-0 at 12 knots.

893
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,900
Three minutes to the embargo line, sir.

894
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,980
God help them if they cross it.

895
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,750
God help us all.

896
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,340
- Sound general quarters.
- General quarters, general quarters.

897
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,970
- All hands man battle stations!
- Yes sir.

898
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,970
Set Condition Zebra.

899
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,720
General quarters, battle stations.

900
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:55,260
Gun boss, target cargo ship, bearing 1-8-0.

901
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,000
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

902
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,720
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, sir.

903
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,550
Looks pretty messy out there.

904
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:57,270
The crew of the Aral Sea are all dead.
Shaw's been there.

905
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:58,970
He's still here, somewhere.

906
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:00,460
He's set the ship on course for the embargo line.

907
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,900
That ship crosses the line, our
boys are going to blow it up.

908
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,650
And the war begins.

909
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,280
Unless they're not on board.

910
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,770
<i>USS Independence,
this is Alexander Nevski.</i>

911
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:14,310
We have lost control of our cargo ship.

912
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:16,990
She's been instructed to stop.
Do not fire.

913
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,750
Repeat, do not fire.

914
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,500
They've signaled their
cargo ship to turn around, sir.

915
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:25,680
It's a ruse, pay no attention.
Stand by to fire.

916
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,960
- Standing by to fire, sir.
- On my count.

917
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:30,200
Five...four...

918
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,600
Hold on! Hold on!

919
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:03,860
No!

920
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,880
- What was that?
- The Russians, they have fired on their own ship.

921
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:14,350
A little warning next time, professor.

922
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,210
Sorry about that.

923
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:16,930
- You all right?
- Yeah.

924
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,370
Son of a...

925
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:21,600
Give me CINCLANT (Commander in Chief, Atlantic Command) on the horn, I want a new set of orders.

926
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:39,940
They say the comrade lost his mind.

927
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,570
The Americans are applauding.

928
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,690
They're here.

929
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,680
That telepath is powerful.

930
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:50,700
We're moving to a back-up plan.

931
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,140
- That was inspired, Charles.
- Thank you very much.

932
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:57,520
But I still can't locate Shaw.

933
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,650
He's down there, we need to find him now.

934
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:00,710
Hank?

935
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:04,870
- Is there anything unusual on the radar or scanners?
- No, nothing.

936
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:08,990
Well then he must be under water.
And obviously we don't have Sonar.

937
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:11,370
Yes we do.

938
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:13,260
Yes we do.

939
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:18,910
They were ready for war.

940
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:21,610
We just need to strike another match
to light the fuse.

941
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:24,500
And we still have the most powerful weapon of all.

942
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,160
Me.

943
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:31,710
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

944
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,730
Hank, level the bloody plane!

945
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:43,950
Whoa, you back right off.

946
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,710
Beast, open the bomb bay doors.

947
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:58,770
Remember, this is a muscle.
You control it.

948
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,920
You'll be in here the entire time.
We'll see you soon.

949
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:09,150
- On my mark. 3, 2, 1 GO!
- WHOA!!!

950
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,170
Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cans off.

951
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,000
Banshee's got a location on Shaw.

952
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:44,520
You ready for this?

953
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:46,350
Let's find out.

954
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:51,860
<i>**Remember, the point between rage and serenity.**</i>

955
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,740
Erik, take my hand!

956
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,970
Oh, hold on guys, it's going to get bumpy.

957
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:34,550
Erik, take my hand!

958
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:08,100
Down.

959
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:25,690
- Moira, Moira, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

960
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:31,970
I read the teleporter's mind.

961
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,020
Shaw's drawing all of the power out of his sub.

962
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:36,170
He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.

963
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:38,320
We've got no time, the Geiger
counter's going out of control.

964
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:39,490
All right Moira, this is what we're going to do.

965
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,830
Get on the radio and tell them to
clear both fleets out immediately.

966
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:42,790
I'm going in.

967
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:44,870
Beast, Havok, back him up.

968
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:46,660
Erik, I can guide you through once you're in.

969
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,130
But I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me.

970
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,180
Then we just hope to God it's
not to late for me to stop him.

971
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,350
- Got it.
- Good luck!

972
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,920
- Raven, stop!
- I'm going to help them.

973
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:55,880
We don't have time for this.

974
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:58,330
Anything comes in that entrance,
you're taking care of it, yes?

975
01:39:59,220 --> 01:39:59,910
Fine.

976
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:16,490
Beast!

977
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:21,900
If we go, you go.

978
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:27,170
We believe Shaw is trying to
detonate some kind of bomb.

979
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:34,130
Erik, make to the middle of the vessel.

980
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:36,180
That's the point my mind can't penetrate.

981
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,310
We have to assume that that's where Shaw is.

982
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,540
Gang way, gang way.

983
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,400
That's the nuclear reactor.
Disable it.

984
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:11,750
Stop, don't move.

985
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,360
Get down!

986
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:44,920
<i>**Erik you're there, you've reached the void.**</i>

987
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:46,800
He's not here Charles,
Shaw is not here.

988
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,990
- He's left the sub.
- What? He's got to be there.

989
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:51,430
He has to be, there's no where
else he can be, keep looking.

990
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,930
And I'm telling you he's not,
there's no one here, god damn it!

991
01:41:57,490 --> 01:42:01,120
Erik, what a pleasant surprise.

992
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,800
Erik?
Erik!

993
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,400
So good to see you again.

994
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,230
May I ask you something?

995
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,240
Why are you on their side?

996
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:28,510
- He's gone.
- What?

997
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:31,550
He's gone into the void. I can't
communicate with him there.

998
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:34,370
Why fight for a doomed race
who will hunt us down,

999
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:37,010
...as soon as they realize
their reign is coming to an end?

1000
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:05,880
Yeah!

1001
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:21,090
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.

1002
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:24,510
I truly am.

1003
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:33,620
He's back.

1004
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:37,010
<i>**Erik, whatever you're doing keep
doing it, it's starting to work.**</i>

1005
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:41,170
But everything I did,
I did for you.

1006
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:45,370
To unlock your power. To make
you embrace it.

1007
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:49,590
<i>**It's working.**</i>

1008
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,890
I'm starting to see him, but I
can't yet touch his mind.

1009
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,080
You've come a long way from bending gates.

1010
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:09,830
I'm so proud of you.

1011
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:20,320
And you're just starting to scratch the surface.

1012
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:24,690
Think how much further we could go, together.

1013
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:45,930
Stop, Azazel!

1014
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,040
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.
I never did.

1015
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,740
I want to help you.

1016
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,180
This is our time.
Our age.

1017
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:12,260
We are the future of the human race.

1018
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:17,500
You and me, son.
This world could be ours.

1019
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,700
Everything you did made me stronger.

1020
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:26,310
Made me the weapon I am today.

1021
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:29,650
That's the truth.

1022
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:32,760
I've known it all along.

1023
01:45:39,010 --> 01:45:40,450
You are my creator.

1024
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:42,380
NOW, Charles!

1025
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:44,860
Are you okay?

1026
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:47,720
Moira be quiet, I can only
control this man for so long.

1027
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:01,890
Sorry, Charles...

1028
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:04,320
<i>**Erik please, be the better man.
You have it in...**</i>

1029
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,370
...But I donâ€™t trust you.

1030
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,810
<i>** Erik, there will be no telling what...**</i>

1031
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:09,380
No.

1032
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,130
- Charles?
- Don't do this, Erik!

1033
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:23,320
If you're in there, I'd like you to know
that I agree with every word you said.

1034
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,070
We are the future.

1035
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:31,290
But...

1036
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:36,010
...unfortunately, you killed my mother.

1037
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:46,290
This is what we're going to do...

1038
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,520
No, please Erik, no.

1039
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:52,320
...I'm going to count to three
and I'm going to move the coin.

1040
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:55,450
One...

1041
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,680
Please, Erik.

1042
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:07,640
Two...

1043
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:15,340
Three.

1044
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,980
Aaaaaaaah!

1045
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:46,090
The Russians share our concerns

1046
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:48,900
and will join a strike on all the mutants.

1047
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,130
We can end this threat for good.

1048
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:53,150
We'll never have another opportunity like this.

1049
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:54,790
We have an agent on that beach.

1050
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,080
- One agent?
- She's a good agent.

1051
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,710
She's collateral damage.

1052
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:07,450
Today our fighting stops.

1053
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,870
Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters.

1054
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:35,880
The real enemy is out there.

1055
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,720
I feel their guns moving in the water.

1056
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,120
Their metal targeting us.

1057
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:46,100
Americans, Soviets, humans.

1058
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,220
United in their fear of the unknown.

1059
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:53,720
A Neanderthal is running scared,
my fellow mutants.

1060
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,620
Go ahead, Charles.

1061
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:01,230
Tell me I'm wrong.

1062
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:23,330
Fleet commander this is X-ray Bravo-7-zero.

1063
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,730
Respond, over.

1064
01:49:25,910 --> 01:49:28,390
The beach is secure, call off the attack.

1065
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:30,800
The beach is targeted and ready to
be fired upon, sir.

1066
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,820
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.

1067
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,740
New Orders. Fire on the beach.

1068
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:38,060
Hello?

1069
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:41,110
Hello!?

1070
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:51,440
Fire.
Fire.

1071
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:39,740
Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men.

1072
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:41,890
This is the time to prove it.

1073
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:47,780
There are thousands of men on those ships.

1074
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:49,510
Good, honest , innocent men.

1075
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:51,750
They're just following orders.

1076
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:56,210
I've been at the mercy of men
just following orders.

1077
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:01,880
Never again.

1078
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,630
Erik, release them.

1079
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:15,780
Noooo!

1080
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:23,610
I don't want to hurt you,
don't make me.

1081
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:25,900
Stay back!

1082
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,650
Charles, enough.

1083
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,510
Erik, stop!

1084
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,960
Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.

1085
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:50,560
Comrades, thank you for your service.

1086
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:36,860
I'm so sorry.

1087
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,520
I said back off!

1088
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:42,950
You, you did this!

1089
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:48,940
Please...

1090
01:52:51,370 --> 01:52:54,990
She didn't do this, Erik.
You did.

1091
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:06,140
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

1092
01:53:06,490 --> 01:53:08,350
I tried to warn you, Charles.

1093
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:14,690
I want you by my side.
We're brothers, you and I.

1094
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:18,240
All of us, together. Protecting each other.

1095
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:22,070
We want the same thing.

1096
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:24,760
Oh, my friend.

1097
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:28,580
I'm sorry, but we do not.

1098
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:49,770
- Charles, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Charles.
- It's all right, it's all right.

1099
01:53:53,730 --> 01:53:55,710
His society won't accept us.

1100
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:58,540
We form our own.

1101
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,630
The humans have played their hand.

1102
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:05,060
Now we get ready to play ours.

1103
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:09,060
Who's with me?

1104
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,590
No more hiding.

1105
01:54:46,870 --> 01:54:51,230
You, you should go with him.
It's what you want.

1106
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:54,060
You promised me you would never read my mind.

1107
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:55,500
I know.

1108
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:58,600
I promised you a great many things,
I'm afraid.

1109
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:00,330
I'm sorry.

1110
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,850
Take care of him.

1111
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:24,200
And Beast, never forget.

1112
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:28,010
Mutant and proud.

1113
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:37,470
Help me out, help him.

1114
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:39,960
I'm going to get you to a hospital.

1115
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:43,170
- Wait, don't, Charles, don't move, okay.

1116
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:48,480
All right, actually I ca.....I...I...

1117
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:51,900
I can't feel my legs

1118
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:55,480
I can't feel my legs.

1119
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,060
I can't feel my legs.

1120
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:13,890
In this week of Thanksgiving,
there is much for which we can be grateful

1121
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:17,260
as you look back to where we stood,
only four weeks ago.

1122
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:20,530
The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies

1123
01:56:20,690 --> 01:56:23,110
and the calm determination of the American people.

1124
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:26,160
These qualities may be tested many more times

1125
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:27,580
in this decade.

1126
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:34,870
So how many students do you think you'll have here?
Once you get the academy up and running.

1127
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:39,060
As many as I can manage. Possibly more.

1128
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,360
You know, one day the government is going
to realize how lucky they were,

1129
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:48,180
..to have Professor X on their side.

1130
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:52,000
I suppose I am a real professor, aren't I.

1131
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,580
Next thing I'll be going bald.

1132
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,430
We're still on the governmentâ€™s side, Moira.

1133
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:00,540
Still G-men, just without the G.

1134
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:03,640
No, you're your own team now.

1135
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:05,500
It's better.

1136
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:09,160
You're "X-Men".

1137
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:12,730
Yes, I like the sound of that.

1138
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:18,960
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.

1139
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,230
I know.

1140
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:25,380
They can threaten me all they want, Charles.

1141
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:28,360
I'll never tell them where you are.

1142
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:29,940
Ever.

1143
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:32,430
I know you won't.

1144
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:35,260
My love.

1145
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:44,790
I remember the attack on HQ.

1146
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,030
Leaving to go somewhere else.

1147
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:50,710
And then this morning, I woke up at home.

1148
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:52,520
That's it.

1149
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:55,800
All that time wiped clean from your mind.

1150
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,240
Just gone.

1151
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:59,550
He can do that.
You don't remember anything?

1152
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:07,550
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like trees, sunlight.

1153
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,350
- A kiss.
- Aw, Jesus.

1154
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:16,220
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA
is no place for a woman.

1155
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,120
What the hell was that?

1156
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:40,300
I know we've had our differences.

1157
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:46,580
- Where's your telepath friend?
- Gone.

1158
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:50,590
Left a bit of a gap in my life.
If I'm to be honest.

1159
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:52,460
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

1160
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,640
Join us.

1161
01:59:05,790 --> 01:59:07,140
Erik, I believe.

1162
01:59:10,370 --> 01:59:12,020
I prefer...

1163
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:14,800
...Magneto.

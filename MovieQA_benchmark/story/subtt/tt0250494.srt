J' Leave the work for someone else

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,009
J' People say

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,084
J' They say that it's just a phase

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,323
They tell me to act my age

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,768
J Well, I am

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,481

J' When nothing can go wrong

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,807
J' It's the perfect day

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,123
J' Tomorrow's gonna come too soon

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,971
J I could stay

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,521
J' Forever as I am

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,163
J' On this perfect day

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,483

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,769
J' In my Mercedes-Benz

Don’t tell me it’s just a dream

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,169
J' 'Cause when I've had enough
You'll hear me say

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,765
Hi!

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,161

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,249
I’m in the race, but I already won

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,966
J' And getting there can be half the fun

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,646
r So don’t stop me till I’m good and done

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,407

J' Nothing can go wrong

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,766
J' On this perfect day...

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,242
(Elle) I love that restaurant!
I heard Madonna went into labor there.

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,609
Oh, gosh, I have to go shopping.
OK. I'll see you tonight.

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,330
OK. Bye.

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,762
Bruiser, what's this?

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,724
(sighs) "Good luck tonight.
Elle and Warner forever."

57
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,962
That's so cute.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,451
(sighs)

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,808
Oh, my gosh. You guys are so sweet.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,807
But I'm not positive
it's gonna happen tonight.

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,531
Hello! He just had lunch
with his grandmother.

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,841
You know he got the rock.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,202
Why else would she have
flown in from Newport?

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,601
It's not like she'd
FedEx a six-carat diamond.

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you really think?

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,162
I can't believe
you're getting engaged!

67
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,041
Oh, my gosh. You guys have
to help me pick out the perfect outfit.

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,486
Come on.

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,323
(woman) I think you should go with
the red. It's the color of confidence.

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,808
I don't understand why you're completely
disregarding your signature color?

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,964
He's proposing. I can't look
like I would on any other date.

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,567
This is the date.
The night I'll always remember.

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,484
I wanna look special.

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,689
Bridal. But not like I expect anything.

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,561
There's nothing I love more than
a dumb blonde with Daddy's plastic.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,721
You know how he gets excited...

77
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,451
Did you see this one?
We just got it in yesterday.

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,683
Oh! Is this low-viscosity rayon?

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,363
Yes, of course.

80
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,045
With a half-loop top stitching
on the hem?

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,010
Absolutely. it's one of a kind.

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,922
It's impossible to use a half-loop
top stitching on low-viscosity rayon.

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,243
It would snag the fabric.
And you didn't just get it in.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,890
I saw it in Teen Vogue a year ago.

85
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,441
So if you're trying
to sell it to me for full price,

86
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,170
you picked the wrong girl.

87
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,051
OW.

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,641
Girls, this is it.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,044
In a few hours, I'll be the future
Mrs. Warner Huntington III.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,251
Hello.

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,770
Wow.

92
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,809
You look so beautiful.

93
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,291
So do you.

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,685
Let's get out of here.

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,120
OK.

96
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,643
It must be strange
having such perfect eyes.

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,850
(Warner) God, you're so wonderful.
Elle, thank you.

98
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,886
- Here's to us.
- To us.

99
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,769
Mmm!

100
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,969
- Elle... (clears throat)
- Yes.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,005
One of the reasons I wanted to come
here tonight was to discuss our future.

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,084
I am fully amenable to that discussion.

103
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,321
Good.

104
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,801
You know how we've been having
all kinds of fun lately?

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,328
Yeah.
- Well, Harvard is gonna be different.

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,250
Law school is a completely different
world, and I need to be serious.

107
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,726
Of course.

108
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,842
I mean, my family
expects a lot from me.

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,289
- Right.
- I expect a lot from me.

110
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,168
I plan on running for office some day.

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,322
And I fully support that, Warner.
You know that, right?

112
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,481
Absolutely.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,929
But the thing is, if I'm gonna
be a senator by the time I'm 30,

114
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,168
I need to stop dicking around.

115
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,041
Oh, Warner... I completely agree.

116
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,650
Well, that's why I think
it's time for us...

117
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,365
...Elle...

118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,046
- ...Pooh Bear...
- Yes?

119
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,041
- I do.
- I think we should break up.

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,881
What'?!

121
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,725
I've been thinking about it,
and I think it's the right thing to do.

122
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,163
You're breaking up with me?

123
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,726
- I thought you were proposing.
- (chuckling) Proposing?

124
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,043
Elle! If I'm gonna be a senator,

125
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,687
well, I need to marry a Jackie,
not a Marilyn. (laughs)

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,287
So you're breaking up with me
because I'm too... blonde?

127
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,727
No. That's not entirely true.

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,241
Then what? My boobs are too big?

129
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,925
(murmuring)

130
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,411
Your boobs are fine.

131
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,201
So when you said you would always love
me, you were just dicking around?

132
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,840
(Warner) Elle, I... I do love you. I...

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,606
- (Elle sobbing)
- ...I just can't marry you.

134
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,445
You have no idea the pressure
that I am under.

135
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,602
My family has five
generations of senators.

136
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,206
My brother's
in the top three at Yale Law,

137
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,051
and he just got engaged
to a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake!

138
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,242
(Elle Screeching)

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,491
Bad salad.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,765
Sweetie... Pooh Bear?

141
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,847
(scoffs)

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,606
It's not like I have
a choice here, sweetheart.

143
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,246
OK, you get the car.
I'll get the check.

144
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,243
(woman) I won't be having salad.

145
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,604
(whimpering)

146
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,768
Come on, let me take you home.

147
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,967
No.

148
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,441
Elle, believe me,
I never expected to do this.

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,690
But I think it's the right thing.

150
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,003
How can it be the right thing
when we're not together?

151
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,921
I have to think of my future
and what my family expects of me.

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,806
So you're breaking up with me because
you're afraid your family won't like me?

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,846
- Everybody likes me.
- Well, East Coast people are different.

154
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,005
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt,
suddenly I'm white trash?

155
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,164
I grew up in Bel Air, Warner,
across the street from Aaron Spelling.

156
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,448
I think most people
would agree that's a lot better

157
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,563
than some stinky old Vanderbilt.

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,167
I told you, I need someone serious.

159
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,001
Well, I'm seriously in love with you.

160
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,806
- (sighs)
- Isn't that enough?

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,691
Pooh Bear, just get in the car.

162
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,844
No. (sniffles)

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,770
You're gonna ruin your shoes.

164
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,086
OK.

165
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,088
Morning, Amy.

166
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,530
Elle, it's Amy. I'm having trouble
with this whole lip-liner thing.

167
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,603
Sweetie, didn't you hear?

168
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,162
- Hear what?
- Oh... It's terrible. He dumped her.

169
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,762
(woman on TV) Why me?

170
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,129
Because you're not gonna remember
anything after tonight.

171
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,004
(woman) Oh, you're wrong.

172
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,005
I will remember; no matter what.

173
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,481
And I’m never gonna lose you again.

174
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,291
(man on TV) You couldn't.
You're a pad of me.

175
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,445
I love you.

176
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,124
Liar!

177
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,807
Honey, you have to leave this room.

178
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,644
It's been, like, a week.

179
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,006
- So?
- Drink this.

180
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,404
What's the one thing that always
makes us feel better, no matter what?

181
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,770
She had eight grilled-cheese sandwiches.

182
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,481
She just stuffed 'em in her mouth,
all at once. It was so sad.

183
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,768
We thought she'd be
the first to walk down the aisle,

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,281
and now she's totally adrift.

185
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,001
Totally.

186
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,928
(woman) She hasn't conditioned
her hair in a week.

187
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,048
(woman 2) Maybe she's
going for the grunge look.

188
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,521
(woman) And, like, her nails
are full-on chipped.

189
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,960
(woman 2) So trailer park.

190
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,330
(speaking Vietnamese)

191
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,330
Oh, my God!

192
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,528
- Do you know who this is?
- No.

193
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,684
- That's Warner's older brother.
- Who?

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,049
"Third-year Yale Law student,
Putnam Bowes Huntington III

195
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,562
and his fiancee,
Layne Walker Vanderbilt,

196
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,929
first year, Yale Law."

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,607
(gasps) This is the type of girl
Warner wants to marry.

198
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,371
This is what I need
to become to be serious.

199
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,205
What? Practically deformed?

200
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,566
No!

201
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,404
A law student.

202
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,560
Elle?

203
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,561
Law school?

204
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,041
It's a perfectly
respectable place, Daddy.

205
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,044
Honey, you were first runner-up

206
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,402
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest.

207
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,562
Why are you gonna throw that all away?

208
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,883
Going to Harvard is the only way
I'm gonna get the love of my life back.

209
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,287
Sweetheart, you don't need law school.

210
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,049
Law school's for people
who are boring and ugly and serious.

211
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,601
And you, button,
are none of those things.

212
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,410
(sighs)

213
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,522
- Harvard Law School?
- That's right.

214
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,045
- But that's a top-three school.
- I have a 4.0.

215
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,046
Yes. But your major
is fashion merchandising.

216
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,766
Harvard won’t be impressed
that you aced History of Polka Dots.

217
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,807
What are your backups?

218
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,770
I don't need backups.
I'm going to Harvard.

219
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,842
Well, then. You'll need excellent
recommendations from your professors.

220
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,405
OK.

221
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,928
- And a heck of an admissions essay.
- Right.

222
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,120
And at least a 175 on your LSATs.

223
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,448
I once had to judge a tighty-Whitey
contest for Lambda Kappa Pi.

224
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,881
Trust me. I can handle anything.

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,843
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

226
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,164
Because I have a metrabolism.
I have a really high metrabolism.

227
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,810
It's metabol...

228
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,168
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

229
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,123
Reading about the LSATs.

230
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,887
My cousin had that.
You get a really bad rash on your...

231
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,360
The LSATs are an exam.
Girls, I'm going to Harvard.

232
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,727
- You mean, like, on vacay?
- Let's all go!

233
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,370
Road trip!

234
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,925
(both shrieking)

235
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,731
No. I'm going to Harvard Law School.

236
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,000
Why?

237
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,604
Elle. Elle...

238
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,162
I know you're upset about all this,
but can't you just take a Percocet?

239
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,848
OK. Once Warner sees me as a serious
law student, he'll totally want me back.

240
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,202
It's a completely brilliant plan.

241
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,286
But isn't it hard
to get into law school?

242
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,647
I have the highest GPA in Delta Nu.

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,209
Oh, well. Here.
You're gonna need this.

244
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,642
- Your scrunchie?
- My lucky scrunchie.

245
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,768
It helped me pass Spanish.

246
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,605
You passed Spanish because
you gave Professor Montoya

247
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,330
a lap dance after the final.

248
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,729
Yeah. Luckily.

249
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,884
(electronic dance music playing)

250
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,722
Oh, hi.

251
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,566
My name is Elle Woods,
and for my admissions essay,

252
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,760
I’m gonna tell all of you at Harvard
why I’m gonna make an amazing lawyer.

253
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,689
As president of my sorority,

254
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,201
I’m skilled at commanding the
attention of a room,

255
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,089
and discussing very important issues.

256
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,208
It has come to my attention
that the maintenance staff

257
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,241
is switching our toilet paper
from Charmin to generic.

258
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,607
All those opposed to chafing, say “aye

259
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,250
Aye'

260
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,647
"A: Neither type of opera
or neither type of rap is on sale.

261
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,168
B: Neither type of jazz
and neither type of opera is on sale.

262
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,603
- C: Neither type of opera..."
- (men hollering)

263
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,967
- Party!
- Delta Nu, we love you!

264
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,811
Hey. Mm-mm.

265
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,610
OK.

266
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,401
I'm able to recall hundreds of
important details at the drop of a hat.

267
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,610
Hey, Elle, do you know what happened
on Days of Our Lives yesterday?

268
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,603
Why yes, Margot, I do.

269
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,804
Once again, we joined Hope
in the search for her identity.

270
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,850
She's been brainwashed
by the evil Stefano.

271
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,971
- Three...
- Get set, and go!

272
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,122
143.

273
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,841
I feel comfortable
using legal jargon in everyday life.

274
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,010
- (man whistles)
- (gasps) I object!

275
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,601
Elle! It's here.

276
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,250
The LSAT scores!

277
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,323
(all chattering excitedly)

278
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,526
(93595)

279
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,650
179!

280
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,007
(all cheering)

281
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,965
179! 179!

282
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,410
And that’s why you should vote for me, Elle Woods,

283
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,809
future lawyer;
for the class of 2004.

284
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,930
She does have a 4.0 from CULA,

285
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,050
and she got a 179 on her LSATs.

286
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,210
A fashion major?

287
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,563
Well, sir, we've never had one before,

288
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,563
and aren't we always
looking for diversity?

289
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,247
Her list of extracurricular
activities is impressive.

290
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,644
- She was in a Ricky Martin video.
- Clearly, she's interested in music.

291
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,927
She also designed a line of...

292
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,404
...faux-fur panties
for her sorority's charity project.

293
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,281
She's a friend to the animals,
as well as a philanthropist.

294
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,245
Elle Woods.

295
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,162
Welcome to Harvard.

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,684
(J' Lisa Loeb
"We Could Still Belong Together")

297
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,287
J' We could still belong together

298
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,683
J' And together is much better

299
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,765
J' We're OK so, hey, don't worry now

300
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,526
J' Oh, wow

301
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,082
J' We could still belong together

302
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,642
J' And together's so much better

303
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,925
J' We're OK so, hey, don't worry now

304
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,162
J' Oh, wow

305
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,843
Oh, Bruiser, it's so exciting.
Look! Harvard.

306
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,162
- Are you excited?
- (barks)

307
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,167
This is our new house
for the next three years.

308
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,685
Oh, are you thirsty?

309
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,729
OK, let's get you some water.

310
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,206
Sweetheart, you just look perched.

311
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,448
(man) Hey, Brad,
check out Malibu Barbie.

312
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,209
Where's the beach, honey?

313
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,971
(Elle) There you go. Good boy.

314
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,322
Warner's gonna be so excited to see you.

315
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,411
Guys, this way.

316
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,562
- (man) This ain't LA!
- (Elle) Come on, Bruiser.

317
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,681
Check it out. Look at the way she walks.

318
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,081
It's gonna be so exciting.
Don't be soared, everyone will love you.

319
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,361
Hi. Woods comma Elle.

320
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,448
Class schedule, map, book list.

321
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,649
Wait a second.
My social events calendar is missing.

322
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,571
Your what?

323
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,485
Social events.
You know, mixers, formals,

324
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,881
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

325
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,647
OK. Has Warner Huntington III
checked in yet?

326
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,326
No.

327
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,404
Maybe you should check with
the cruise director on the lido deck.

328
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,607
OK. Welcome to law school.

329
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,401
This is the pan where we
go around in a circle

330
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,968
and everyone says
a little bit about themselves.

331
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,765
Let's start with you.

332
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,569
My name is David Kidney.

333
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,724
I have a Master's
in Russian literature,

334
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,611
a PhD in biochemistry, and...

335
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,448
...for the last 18 months,
I've been deworming orphans in Somalia.

336
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,610
- Awesome. What about you?
- Hey. How you doin'? I'm Enid Wexler.

337
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,603
Got a PhD from Berkeley
in women's studies,

338
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,081
emphasis in the history of combat.

339
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,808
Last year, I single-handedly organized

340
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,962
the march for Lesbians
Against Drunk Driving.

341
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,805
- Killer.
- Thanks. Good times.

342
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,650
Aaron Mitchell. I graduated
first in my class from Princeton.

343
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,246
-I have an IQ of 187.
- (both snort)

344
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,570
It's been suggested that Stephen Hawking
stole his Brief History of Time...

345
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,962
...from my fourth-grade paper.

346
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,043
Cool.

347
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,368
- Me?
- Yeah.

348
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,844
OK. Hi. I'm Elle Woods
and this is Bruiser Woods.

349
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,122
We're both Gemini vegetarians.

350
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,365
I have a bachelor's degree
in fashion merchandising from CULA.

351
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,648
And I was a Zeta Lambda Nu Sweetheart,

352
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,649
president of my sorority, Delta Nu,

353
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,161
and last year I was Homecoming Queen.

354
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,449
Oh! Two weeks ago
I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal,

355
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,371
and I talked her out of buying
this truly heinous angora sweater.

356
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,962
Whoever said orange was
the new pink was seriously disturbed.

357
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,524
(Elle chuckles)

358
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,526
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

359
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,365
This is my first class
as a serious law student.

360
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,286
I totally look the part.

361
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,331
(whimpers)

362
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,087
Hi.

363
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,886
Hey.

364
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,649
Elle?

365
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,361
Warner?
I totally forgot you go here.

366
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,166
What are you talking about?

367
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,402
I'm sorry. Are you here to see me?

368
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,325
No, silly. I go here.

369
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,970
- You go where?
- Harvard. Law School.

370
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,851
You got into Harvard Law?

371
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,044
What, like it's hard?

372
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,089
Oh, my gosh. It's gonna be so great.

373
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,607
I'm planning this great mixer.
You totally have to help me.

374
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,411
I’m thinking, like, a luau or maybe a casino night.

375
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,490
This is gonna be just
like senior year, except for funner.

376
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,487
Uh-huh.

377
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,048
Oh, time to go. I have to go to class,

378
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,283
but meet me after,
on the benches, OK? Bye!

379
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,606
(woman) A legal education...

380
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,600
...means you will
learn to speak in a new language.

381
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,006
You will be taught to achieve
insight into the world around you,

382
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,801
and to sharply question what you know.

383
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,924
The seat you have picked will be yours

384
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,129
for the next nine months of your life!

385
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,009
And those of you in the front row...

386
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,281
. . beware.

387
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,486
"The law is reason free from passion."

388
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,008
Does anyone know
who spoke those immortal words?

389
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,165
Yes?

390
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,810
Aristotle.

391
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,840
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

392
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,322
Would you be willing
to stake your life on it?

393
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,286
I think so.

394
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,925
What about...

395
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,171
- OW!
- ...his life?

396
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,610
- I don't know.
- Well...

397
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,082
...I recommend
knowing before speaking.

398
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,009
The law leaves much room
for interpretation...

399
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,289
...but very little for self-doubt.

400
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,085
And you were right.

401
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,048
- It was Aristotle.
- (girl whispering) Good job.

402
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,887
Now, I assume all of you
have read pages one through 48,

403
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,203
and are now well-versed
in subject matter jurisdiction.

404
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,041
Who can tell us
about Gordon v. Steele?

405
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,885
Let's call on someone from the hot zone.

406
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,724
(chuckling)

407
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,010
Elle Woods?

408
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,129
Oh... (laughing)

409
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,007
Actually, I wasn't aware
that we had an assignment.

410
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,923
Oh. (chuckling)

411
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,085
Vivian Kensington.

412
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,002
Do you think it's acceptable
that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

413
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,611
No.

414
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,971
I don't.

415
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,962
Would you support my decision
to ask her to leave class,

416
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,124
and to return only
when she is prepared?

417
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,126
Absolutely.

418
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,447
(huffs)

419
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,365
Now, Ms. Kensington...

420
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,683
Did diversity jurisdiction
exist in this case?

421
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,968
No, it did not.

422
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,442
Good. However, in the case of...

423
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,804
(exasperated sigh)

424
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,487
(splutters)

425
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,367
Excuse me. Are you OK?

426
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,011
Yeah.

427
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,721
But do they put you on the spot
like that, like, all the time?

428
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,851
The professors? Yeah, they tend
to do that. Socratic method.

429
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,327
So, if you don't know the answer,
they're just gonna kick you out?

430
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,246
- So you have Stromwell, huh?
- Yes! Did she do that to you too?

431
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,607
No. But she did make me cry once.

432
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,728
Not in class, I waited till
I got back to my room.

433
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,201
But she'll kick you right in the ball...

434
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,771
Or wherever, you know.

435
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,207
But, yeah, she's tough. Really tough.

436
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,167
Great.

437
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,891
Don't worry, though. It gets better.
Who else do you have?

438
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,047
CD 0 0 0 C 0 C CD

439
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,204
Yeah. Let's see.
Speak up in Callahan's class.

440
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,010
He really likes people
that are opinionated.

441
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,925
0 Ci) C) Ci) 0

442
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,204
...try to get a seat in the back.

443
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,489
He tends to spit when
he talks about products liability.

444
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,406
And... for Levinthal,
make sure you read the footnotes,

445
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,325
'cause that's where he gets
a lot of his exam questions from.

446
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,881
Right.

447
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,645
Wow. I'm really glad I met you.

448
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,687
- Hey.
- Are you a third-year?

449
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,127
- Well, I'm a...
- (Warner) Hey, Elle.

450
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,566
Hi.

451
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,007
- Thanks for all your help.
- Good luck.

452
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,961
- Hi, Warner.
- Hi...

453
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,048
So... (chuckles)

454
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,521
- How was your first class?
- It was good,

455
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,966
except for this horrible preppy girl

456
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,567
who tried to make me look bad in front
of the professor, but no biggie.

457
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,041
You're here now.
So how was your summer?

458
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,929
Good. It was good.

459
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,570
Did you do anything exciting?

460
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,884
(chuckling) Hey!

461
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,601
Have... Have you met Viv... ian?

462
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,286
Oh, hi. Vivian Kensington.

463
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,207
- Do you know her?
- She's...

464
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,442
I'm his fiancée.

465
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,088
I'm sorry. I just hallucinated.

466
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,810
What?

467
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,928
Yeah... She...

468
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,924
She was my girlfriend in prep school.

469
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,404
Well, we got back together this summer
at my grandmother's birthday party.

470
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,690
Warner told me all about you.

471
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,680
You're famous at our club.

472
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,403
But he didn't tell me you'd be here.

473
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,561
Pooh Bear, I didn't know
she would be here.

474
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,560
Excuse me.

475
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,801
(loud rock music playing)

476
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,881
- (tires screeching)
- (woman) Hey, watch out!

477
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,211
Thank God!

478
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,284
(indistinct shouting continues)

479
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,963
(whimpering)

480
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,401
(sniffling) Are you free?
It's an emergency.

481
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,210
- Bad day?
- You can't even imagine.

482
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,201
Spin.

483
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,364
(breaking down) I worked
so hard to get into law school.

484
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,321
I blew off Greek Week
to study for the LSATS.

485
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,086
I even hired a Coppola
to direct my admissions video.

486
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,049
All to get my boyfriend Warner back,

487
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,726
and now he's engaged
to this awful girl, Vivian.

488
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,282
So it was all for nothing, and I...
I just wish...

489
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,649
...I just wish I had
never gone to Harvard.

490
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,047
- After you went to all that trouble.
- He's engaged.

491
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,768
She's got the six-carat Harry Winston
on her bony, unpolished finger.

492
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,888
What am I supposed to do?

493
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,401
You're askin' the wrong girl.

494
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,645
I mean, I'm with my guy eight years,
and then one day it's,

495
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,286
"I met someone else. Move out."

496
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,922
Oh, no. That's awful.

497
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,323
Dewey kept the trailer
and my precious baby, Rufus.

498
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,762
I didn't even get to throw him
a birthday party.

499
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,888
No!

500
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,088
I mean, what's a girl to do?

501
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,086
He's a guy who followed
his pecker to greener pastures,

502
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,090
and I'm a middle-aged
high school dropout...

503
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,366
...who's got stretch marks
and a fat ass.

504
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,364
- That's terrible.
- Yeah. Happens every day.

505
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,450
So what's this Vivian got
that you don't have?

506
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,761
Three tits?

507
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,965
(sighs) She's from Connecticut.
She belongs to his stupid country club.

508
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,849
Is she as pretty as you?

509
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,642
She could use some mascara
and some serious highlights, but...

510
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,485
...she's not completely
unfortunate-looking.

511
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,962
Hello, ladies. How ya doin'?

512
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,884
Sign here.

513
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,449
Oh, look what I did.

514
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,489
- See you later.
- Bye, sugar.

515
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,130
Oh, shit.

516
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,331
Could I have been
any more goddamn spastic?

517
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,161
It's OK.

518
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,002
Are you sure this Warner guy
is, like, the one?

519
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,130
Definitely. I love him.

520
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,370
Mmm...

521
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,688
If a girl like you
can't hold on to her man,

522
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,640
then there sure as hell
isn't any hope for the rest of us.

523
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,650
What are you waitin' for?

524
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,961
Steal the bastard back.

525
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,367
I should warn you, that in addition
to competing against each other

526
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,091
for the top grade in this class,

527
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,481
you will also be competing
for one of my firm's

528
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,440
highly-coveted four internship
spots next year,

529
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,047
where you will get
to assist on actual cases.

530
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,601
Let the bloodbath begin.

531
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,211
(all chuckling)

532
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,364
Now, let's commence
with our usual torture.

533
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,724
Ms. Woods.

534
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,127
Would you rather have a client
who committed a crime malum in se,

535
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,203
or malum prohibitum?

536
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,485
- Neither.
- Why is that?

537
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,761
I would rather have
a client who's innocent.

538
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,002
(all laughing)

539
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,401
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

540
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,171
Ms. Kensington, which would you prefer?

541
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,765
Malum prohibitum.

542
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,763
Because then the client would've
committed a regulatory infraction,

543
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,241
as opposed to a dangerous crime.

544
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,607
(Callahan) Well done, Ms. Kensington.

545
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,047
You've obviously done your homework.

546
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,930
Now, let us look at malum prohibitum
a little more closely.

547
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,570
It has been said...

548
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,926
Yes, Ms. Woods?

549
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,925
I changed my mind.
I'd pick the dangerous one,

550
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,287
'cause I'm not afraid of a challenge.

551
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,161
- (man) Hike!
- (all shouting)

552
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,121
Who is that?

553
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,206
Guys...

554
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,770
- Hi!
- (man) Warner, do you know her?

555
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,126
Hi.

556
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,361
- Hi, everybody.
- Elle. What are you doing here?

557
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,444
I've come to join your study group.
And look, I brought sustenance.

558
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,524
- Who's first?
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Our group is full.

559
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,163
- Oh, is this like an RSVP thing?
- No, it's like a smart-people thing.

560
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,561
And, as Viv said, we're full.

561
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,366
Come on, guys.
We can make room for one more.

562
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,205
- OW!
- We've already assigned the outlines.

563
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,729
The answer is no.

564
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,524
OK. I'll just leave, then.

565
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,286
(whispers) Bye.

566
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,401
Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority
you could, like, join instead, like...

567
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,040
You know, if you had come
to a rush party,

568
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,531
I would have at least been nice to you.

569
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,921
Oh, is that before
you voted against me,

570
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,844
then called me a dyke behind my back?

571
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,567
- I don't use that word.
- (scoffs)

572
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,364
You must have heard it from Vivian.

573
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,848
(dialing)

574
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,367
- (Margot) Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

575
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,726
It's Elle!

576
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,167
Guess what I'm doing right this second?

577
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,243
(Elle) I don’t know. What?

578
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,721
I'm picking out my wedding dress!

579
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,526
- What?
- Josh proposed.

580
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,410
Did you get the rock yet?

581
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,646
Almost.

582
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,963
Well, hurry up, so you can come home.
We miss you.

583
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,283
(sighs) I miss you guys too.
The people here are so vile.

584
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,926
- Hardly anybody speaks to me, unless...
- Oh, my God.

585
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,684
I almost forgot to tell you.

586
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,766
- What?
- I got bangs.

587
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,922
- My hair is so ”now. ”
- Really?

588
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,603
OK, so just listen to me.
Keep June 1st open.

589
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,765
You're one of my bridesmaids.
And give Warner our love.

590
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,400
Because I'm getting married!
I'm getting...

591
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,483
- (fabric rips)
- (shrieks)

592
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,688
(dial tone)

593
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,681
So don't forget.
Eight o'clock at 45 Dunstan Street.

594
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,649
It'll be a really nice party.

595
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,408
Oh, and don't forget
to bring your own merlot.

596
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,968
No way! Is somebody at this school
actually... having a party?

597
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,484
YES.

598
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,010
But it's a costume party.
You probably wouldn't wanna come.

599
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,769
I love costume parties.

600
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,925
Oh. Well, then,
I guess we'll see you there.

601
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,326
OK.

602
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,326
Oh. At 45 Dunstan Street. OK.

603
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,885
(Bruiser growling)

604
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,766
(J' Black Eyed Peas "Magic")

605
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,290
Oh, my God!

606
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,331
Hey.

607
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,682
Thanks for inviting me, girls.
This party is super fun.

608
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,209
- Nice outfit.
- Oh, I like your outfit, too.

609
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,442
Except when I dress up
as a frigid bitch,

610
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,887
I try not to look so constipated.

611
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,361
(laughing)

612
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,002
(huffs) She's horrible.

613
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,045
You've got the ring, sweetie.

614
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,047
How you doin'?

615
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,728
(Enid) Warner! The English language
is all about subliminal domination.

616
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,565
Take the word, "semester," OK?
This is a perfect example

617
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,246
of this school's discriminatory
preference of semen to ovaries.

618
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,767
That's why I'm petitioning
to have next term be referred to

619
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,410
as the winter "ovester."

620
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,722
Excuse me. Hey, Warner.

621
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,163
Wow. Well, don't you look
like a walking felony?

622
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,971
- Thank you. You're so sweet.
- (Enid) Ugh!

623
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,930
- (chuckling) Are you having fun?
- I am now.

624
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,401
What... What's with the costume?

625
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,801
Oh. I just decided to dress up.

626
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,961
Really?

627
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,010
You know, I feel like we barely get to
see each other since we've been here.

628
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,289
I know. I'm so busy
with these case studies and hypos.

629
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,687
I know you mean.
I can't imagine doing all this

630
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,081
and Callahan's internship next year.

631
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,044
This is gonna be so much.

632
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,287
Oh, Elle...

633
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,169
Come on, you're never
gonna get the grades

634
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,970
to qualify for one of those spots.

635
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,921
You're not smart enough, sweetie.

636
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,241
Wait. Am I on glue, or did we not
get into the same law school, Warner?

637
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,607
- Well, yeah, but...
- But what?

638
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,287
We took the same LSATs,
and we’re taking the same classes.

639
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,445
I know. But come on, Elle, be serious.

640
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,967
You can do something
more valuable with your time.

641
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,367
I'm never gonna be
good enough for you, am I?

642
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,089
- Elle, come on.
- Just forget it.

643
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,726
(pop music playing)

644
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,331
I'll show you how valuable
Elle Woods can be.

645
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,485
(clears throat)

646
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,330
- (sighs) Don't ask.
- Wasn't gonna.

647
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,840
I love that sweater. It's Chanel.

648
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,967
- Look.
- Is she carrying books?

649
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,405
Thanks.

650
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,285
So, you've filed a claim.

651
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,046
What next?

652
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,170
Ms. Woods?

653
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,763
- Don't you need to have evidence?
- Meaning?

654
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,610
Meaning you need reasonable belief

655
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,971
that your claim should have, like,
evidentiary support?

656
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,888
And what kind of evidentiary support
does this case require?

657
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,405
(dog on TV) Yo quiero Taco Bell.

658
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,886
(barking)

659
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,208
Welcome back...

660
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,124
In the article, you talk
about all sorts of things:

661
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,725
corrupt cops. .. ..

662
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,881
And the purpose
of diminished capacity is?

663
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,089
To negate mens rea?

664
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,121
Are you ready?

665
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,170
(sighs) No.

666
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,322
Yes. Yes, you are.

667
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,562
Go. You can do this.

668
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,285
"Listen to me, Dewey.
You shut your mouth."

669
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,127
No. "You shut your big mouth."

670
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,888
"I'm doing all the talking."

671
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,008
(TV chattering)

672
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,128
(man laughing)

673
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,888
What the hell do you want?
We're eatin' lunch.

674
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,520
I just thought that...

675
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,810
You just thought you could come and
show me what I'm definitely not missin'?

676
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,525
(chuckling)

677
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,847
That's not why I came by.

678
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,368
Paulette, how many times you gonna
come here beggin' me to take you back?

679
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,930
(Paulette) I was... I...

680
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,924
- (Elle) Dewey Newcombe?
- Who's askin'?

681
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,487
I'm Elle Woods,
Ms. Bonifante's attorney.

682
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,207
And I'm here to discuss
the legal situation at hand.

683
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,531
Come again?

684
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,968
Do you understand
what subject matter jurisdiction is?

685
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,168
- No.
-I didn't think so.

686
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,842
Well, due to... habeas corpus,

687
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,368
you and Ms. Bonifante
had a common law marriage,

688
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,969
which, heretofore, entitles her
to what is legally referred to

689
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,203
as "equitable division of the assets."

690
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,361
Come again?

691
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,323
Due to the fact that you've retained...
this residence...

692
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,882
...Ms. Bonifante is entitled
to full canine property ownership,

693
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,929
and will be enforcing said ownership...

694
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,041
...right now.

695
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,930
- Huh?
- Tell him, Paulette.

696
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,802
I'm takin' the dog... dumbass!

697
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,170
- (both laughing)
- (Elle) We did it!

698
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,648
Come here.

699
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,929
Oh, my gosh, did you see him?
He's probably still scratching his head.

700
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,890
Which must be
a nice vacation for his balls.

701
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,248
- (Rufus whimpers)
- Oh...

702
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,171
Thank you.

703
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,849
C) C) C -' 9- I

704
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,241
Swinney, who was also
a private sperm donor,

705
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,886
was allowed visitation rights
as long as he came to terms

706
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,042
with the hours set forth by the parents.

707
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,167
So, if we're sticking to past precedent,
I mean, Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

708
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,724
He was clearly within his rights
to ask for visitation.

709
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,123
But Swinney was
a one-time sperm donor.

710
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,682
And, in our case, the defendant
was an habitual sperm donor,

711
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,885
who also happens to be harassing
the parents in his quest for visitation.

712
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,407
Well, yeah, but I mean,
without this man's sperm...

713
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,885
...the child in question wouldn't exist.

714
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,008
Now you're thinking like a lawyer.

715
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,490
Yes, Ms. Woods?

716
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,767
Although Mr. Huntington
makes an excellent point,

717
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,810
I have to wonder
if the defendant kept a thorough record

718
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,804
of every sperm emission
made throughout his life.

719
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,566
(all chuckling)

720
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,484
Interesting. Why do you ask?

721
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,803
Well, unless the defendant attempted

722
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,002
to Contact every single
one-night stand

723
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,527
to determine if a child
resulted in those unions,

724
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,524
he has no parental claim
over this child, whatsoever.

725
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,603
Why now? Why this sperm?

726
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,090
- I see your point.
- And for that matter,

727
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,006
all masturbatory emissions where his
sperm was clearly not seeking an egg,

728
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,810
could be termed reckless abandonment.

729
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,090
I believe you've just won your case.

730
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,009
- Ms. Woods, you did well today.
- Really?

731
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,645
You're applying
for my internship, aren't you?

732
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,604
- I don't know.
- Well, you should.

733
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,809
- Do you have a résumé?
- Yes, I do.

734
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,646
Here it is.

735
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,522
- it's pink.
- Oh, and it's scented.

736
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,251
I think it gives it a little
something extra, don't you think?

737
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,490
OK. Well, see you next class.

738
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,249
Do you think she woke up
one morning and said,

739
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,681
"I think I'll go to law school today?"

740
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,731
Well, that lapse in judgment aside,
I think she's got a lot of potential.

741
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,522
Here's the Windham file.

742
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,485
Smell this.

743
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,640
- What's that?
- It's her résumé.

744
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,885
It smells good.

745
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,650
(Elle) What's going on?

746
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,201
Callahan's firm
is defending a murder trial.

747
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,768
His case load is so big,
he's taking on first-year interns.

748
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,481
- He picked 'em already?
- (Vivian) I can't believe it, Warner!

749
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,123
- We got it!
- Yes.

750
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,881
That only leaves one for...

751
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,930
(93595)

752
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,486
Me!

753
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,811
Yes!

754
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,766
Oh, Warner.

755
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,689
Do you remember when
we spent those four amazing hours

756
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,808
in the hot tub after Winter Formal?

757
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,201
Yeah... No. (clears throat)

758
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,771
This is so much better than that!

759
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,603
Excuse me. I have some shopping to do.

760
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,768
Four hours?

761
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,049
(elevator dings)

762
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,567
(Warner clears throat)

763
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,120
You look very nice today, Vivian.

764
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,566
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

765
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,002
We're defending Brooke Windham,
whose very wealthy husband

766
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,771
was found shot dead
in their Beacon Hill mansion.

767
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,809
- Gold-digger?
- You'd think so,

768
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,209
since the stiff was 60,
but she was rich on her own.

769
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,691
Some kind of fitness empire.

770
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,281
You can buy her exercise tapes
on infomercials.

771
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,011
Wait, are you
talking about Brooke Taylor?

772
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,242
Maiden name, Taylor. You know her?

773
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,131
She's a Delta Nu.
She wasn't in my pledge class.

774
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,282
She graduated four years before me.

775
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,165
But I used to take her class
at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

776
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,731
She's amazing.

777
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,526
"Amazing?" How?

778
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,967
She can make you lose
three pounds in one class.

779
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,202
She's completely gifted.

780
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,045
Well, in all likelihood,
she's completely guilty as well.

781
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,927
She was seen standing
over her husbands body.

782
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,565
By who?

783
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,246
His 26-year-old daughter
and the pool boy.

784
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,489
- Sorry I'm late. Excuse me.
- This is Emmett Richmond, an associate.

785
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,201
Top three in his class
and former editor of Harvard Law Review.

786
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,764
You've probably seen him lurking
around campus doing my research.

787
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,763
Thanks for the introduction.

788
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,570
(Warner) So, what about
the murder weapon?

789
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,324
(Callahan) The gun is missing.

790
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,091
Coroner said he'd been dead
30 minutes when the cops arrived,

791
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,129
giving Brooke
plenty of time to stash it.

792
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,204
I just don't think Brooke
could have done this.

793
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,607
Exercise gives you endorphins.
Endorphins make you happy.

794
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,649
Happy people just don't
shoot their husbands.

795
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,571
They just don't.

796
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,765
I didn't do it.

797
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,450
I walked in. I saw my husband
lying on the floor.

798
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,362
I bent down to check his heart,
screamed my head off,

799
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,965
and then Enrique
and Chutney ran inside.

800
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,646
OK, your stepdaughter
and the pool boy came in,

801
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,242
where they saw you standing
over the body, covered in his blood.

802
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,964
Why would I kill my husband?

803
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,408
Insurance? A love affair?
Pure unadulterated hatred?

804
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,887
Believe me, the DA will
come up with plenty of reasons.

805
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,846
I loved him.

806
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,891
He was 34 years older than you.

807
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,771
That doesn't look so good to a jury.

808
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,490
Then show them a picture of his dick.

809
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,403
That might clear a few things up.

810
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,408
Brooke, I believe you.

811
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,450
But a jury is gonna want an alibi.

812
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,602
Well, I can't give you that.

813
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,491
And if you put me
on the stand, I'll lie.

814
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,530
Well, then,
I guess we're done for today.

815
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,370
- (door look buzzes)
- (door opens)

816
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,885
(sighs)

817
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,767
- Hey. I know you.
- Hi.

818
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,083
I'm a Delta Nu.
And I'm a huge fan of yours.

819
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,968
- You took my class in LA.
- Uh-huh.

820
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,487
You had the best high kick
I've ever seen.

821
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,204
- Are you one of my lawyers?
- Yeah, sort of.

822
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,401
Well, thank God one of you has a brain.

823
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,561
Let's go.

824
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,847
(J' KC & The Sunshine Band
"That's The Way I Like it")

825
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,327
I'm the only one that believes her.
Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.

826
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,211
That's 'cause men
are big fat retards who don't...

827
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,361
(door opens)

828
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,888
- Afternoon, ladies.
- (whispering) it's him.

829
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,967
Paulette Bonifante.

830
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,766
Oh, my God.

831
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,685
(whispering) He's coming over here.

832
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,971
I've got a package.

833
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,566
He's got a package.

834
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,167
- How you doin' today?
- Fine.

835
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,090
Take it easy.

836
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,448
- See you later.
- (woman) Take it easy.

837
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,607
(door closes)

838
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,125
That's great, Paulette.

839
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,203
Is this the only interaction
you two have ever had?

840
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,930
No!

841
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,526
Sometimes I say, "OK,"
instead of "fine."

842
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,490
Why don't you offer him a cold beverage,
or a neck massage, or something?

843
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,009
- Oh, come on, what's the point?
- Trust me. You have all the equipment.

844
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,611
You just need to read the manual.

845
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,291
Do you know what I'm saying?

846
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,043
I'm gonna show a little maneuver
that my mother taught me in junior high.

847
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,329
In my experience,
it has a 98 percent success rate

848
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,324
of getting a man's attention and,
when used appropriately,

849
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,848
it has an 83 percent rate
of return on a dinner invitation.

850
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,206
Wow.

851
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,287
It's called the "bend and snap."
Watch this.

852
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,961
(gasps) I think I dropped something
that I need to pick up.

853
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,521
So you bend...

854
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,331
...and snap. See?

855
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,811
Come on. You try.

856
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,800
Bend... and snap.

857
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,327
OK...

858
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,290
Yeah. A little less bend,
a little more snap.

859
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,240
Like this?

860
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,329
Good snap! Come on.

861
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,443
You! Come on. You can do it.

862
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,001
Bend... and snap.

863
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,770
We can all do it. Come on, guys!

864
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,001
(pop music playing)

865
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,369
You're gonna bend... and snap.

866
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,760
Now put your head into it.

867
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,082
Bend... and snap.

868
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,088
Bend... and snap.

869
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,523
Good job!
A little attitude, please.

870
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,367
Now, everybody, smile.
That's very important.

871
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,044
Pump! Pump, pump!

872
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,567
Bend... and snap.

873
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,563
Good job, everybody.

874
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,882
Work it out! Work it out!

875
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,450
Wow!

876
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,846
Come on, Paulette.

877
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,847
Bend... and snap.

878
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,210
Oh, my God. The bend and snap.
Works every time.

879
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,645
Well, if Brooke didn't kill the guy,
then who did?

880
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,531
My money is on
the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

881
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,886
Chutney has a trust fund.

882
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,361
She didn't need the insurance payoff
or the inheritance.

883
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,000
- What about the mother?
- Covered. She was in Aspen.

884
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,929
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

885
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,761
Ten people saw her downing
cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.

886
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,403
- All I know is that it's not Brooke.
- That's touching. But we need an alibi.

887
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,249
(Elle) I brought you some necessities.
Some Calvin Klein 720-count sheets,

888
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,562
the entire Clinique skincare line,

889
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,809
some aromatherapy candles, a loofah....

890
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,564
Oh!

891
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,927
And... the bible.

892
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,927
You're an angel.

893
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,321
So how are you? Are you all right?

894
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,245
You look so... orange.

895
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,563
(sighs) I'm just glad that it's you
and not Callahan.

896
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,322
He means well. He's very brilliant.

897
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,767
He better be,
for what I'm paying for him.

898
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,641
I have to tell you
the real reason I came here.

899
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,804
Professor Callahan says
we really, really need your alibi.

900
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,489
Elle, I can't.

901
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,325
- I mean, you don't understand.
- Who could understand better than me?

902
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,848
It's so shameful.

903
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,162
Whatever it is, Brooke,
it could save you.

904
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,971
No, that's just it.
It would ruin me.

905
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,601
How?

906
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,328
I've made my fortune on the ability
to perfect women's bodies

907
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,970
with Brooke's butt-buster workout.

908
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,408
- You helped me go from a six to a four.
- That's great!

909
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,808
On the day of Heyworth's murder...

910
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,969
(whispers indistinctly)

911
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,845
What?

912
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,206
I was getting...

913
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,844
- Huh?
- Liposuction!

914
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,650
- (93595)
- Oh, God!

915
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,451
- No!
- I know! I'm a fraud!

916
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,961
But it's not like normal women
can have this ass!

917
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,843
If my fans knew that I bought it,
I would lose everything.

918
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,802
I've already lost my husband.

919
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,051
I'd rather go to jail
than lose my reputation.

920
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,845
Brooke...

921
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,528
...your secret's safe with me.

922
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,683
Thank you.

923
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,045
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

924
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,890
We got two interviews tomorrow that Gerard and Bobby are gonna handle,

925
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,087
and the ex-wife in an hour.

926
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,891
According to this Communiqué
from the prison,

927
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,566
our client apparently
had a visit from her sister.

928
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,571
A Miss Delta Nu.

929
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,760
- Anyone you know?
- Yes. I went to visit her.

930
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,845
What the hell do you mean,
you "went to visit her"?

931
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,240
I went to get her alibi.

932
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,961
- Did you get it?
- Mm-hmm. It's really good.

933
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,448
Well, great. What is it?

934
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,207
- Oh, I can't tell you.
- Why the hell not?

935
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,567
Because I promised her
I'd keep it a secret.

936
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,404
And I can't break
the bonds of Sisterhood.

937
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,971
Screw Sisterhood!

938
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,090
This is a murder trial,
not some scandal at the sorority house.

939
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,163
I want the alibi.

940
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,450
I can't give it to you.
But I can tell you she is innocent.

941
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,244
Mr. Callahan, Mrs. Windham
Vandermark is on line two for you.

942
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,609
Someone reason with her
while I take this.

943
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,482
Are you crazy?
Just tell him the alibi.

944
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,881
- No!
- We'll lose the case if you don't.

945
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,769
Then we're not very good lawyers.

946
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,890
If you tell him, he'll probably
hire you as a summer associate.

947
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,010
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

948
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,603
- I gave her my word, Warner.
- So what?

949
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,564
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned

950
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,484
with the fact that
her interview is today.

951
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,041
- She's at a spa in the Berkshires.
- A spa.

952
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,885
Isn't that kind of like
your mother ship?

953
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,010
I could go if you want me to.

954
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,366
- Emmett.
- Yeah?

955
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,131
- Go with her.
- OK.

956
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,327
- She seems completely untrustworthy.
- Why?

957
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,725
This is a person who's made her
living by telling women they're too fat.

958
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,247
Brooke would never
tell a woman that she was too fat.

959
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,210
And she seems to me
like she's hiding something.

960
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,681
- Maybe it's not what you think.
- Maybe it's exactly what I think.

961
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,803
You know,
you're really being a butthead.

962
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,080
A butthead?
Why would you call me that?

963
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,245
You just need to have a little more
faith in people. You might be surprised.

964
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,165
I can't believe you just
called me a butthead.

965
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,721
No one's called me that
since about the ninth grade.

966
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,043
(chuckles) Maybe not to your face.

967
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,366
So this is what a spa looks like.
Wow. How do we find her?

968
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,844
- I called ahead. She's in the mud room.
- She's not... naked, is she?

969
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,170
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

970
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,002
So, you found me.

971
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,529
Yes. We're from Austen,
Platt, Jaret & Callahan.

972
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,728
We're here to ask you a few questions.

973
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,805
So, I hear that that little tart
from California shot poor Heyworth.

974
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,971
Well, that's what we're trying
to prove didn't happen.

975
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,043
Do you have any reason
to believe that it did?

976
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,086
Well, I've never actually met the woman.

977
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,164
But my daughter tells me
she can be quite the little bitch.

978
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,402
Now, did your daughter
ever mention anything to you

979
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,370
about the relationship
between Brooke and Heyworth?

980
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,487
Well, she did say that
they humped like gorillas.

981
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,889
I guess it wasn't enough,
though, for Brooke.

982
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,729
- Why do you say that?
- Well... (chuckles)

983
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,763
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?

984
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,243
- She's lying.
- And you know this for a fact?

985
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,562
Did you see the icky brown
color of her hair?

986
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,889
So? Now you discriminate
against brunettes?

987
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,407
(Elle) Why shouldn't I?
I'm discriminated against as a blonde.

988
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,887
(Emmett) You know, being a blonde
is actually a pretty powerful thing.

989
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,769
You hold more cards
than you think you do.

990
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,810
I personally would like
to see you take that power

991
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,930
and channel it
towards the greater good.

992
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,810
- Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

993
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,008
- Hey.
- Yeah?

994
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,089
How do you think I'd look as a blond?

995
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,561
Hmm... I'm not sure you could handle it.

996
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,290
- Bye.
- Bye.

997
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,125
(David) So I called
your room last night.

998
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,361
(woman) I heard.

999
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,648
I was thinking maybe
we could go out sometime.

1000
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,962
(woman) No. You're a dork.

1001
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,682
(David) I'm in... law school.

1002
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,649
Look, I'm not gonna go out with you.

1003
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,802
I can't believe you'd even ask.

1004
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,281
Girls like me don't go out
with losers like you.

1005
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,805
Let's get out of here.

1006
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,485
Excuse me.

1007
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,801
- Why didn't you call me?
- What?

1008
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,089
We spent a beautiful night together,
and I never hear from you again?

1009
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,481
I'm sorry?

1010
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,324
Sorry for what? For breaking my heart?

1011
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,847
Or for giving me the greatest
pleasure I've ever known

1012
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,048
and then just taking it away?

1013
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,811
Both?

1014
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,363
Well, forget it. I've already spent
too many hours crying over you.

1015
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,644
So... when did you wanna go out?

1016
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,680
(exhales)

1017
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,488
- (knocking on door)
- Come in.

1018
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,842
Are you done with that deposition yet?

1019
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,761
Oh, yeah. Here, take it.
I've read it, like, 20 times.

1020
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,203
OK.

1021
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,726
You know, Elle...

1022
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,767
I still can't believe you
didn't tell Callahan the alibi.

1023
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,889
It's not my alibi to tell.

1024
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,403
I know. And I thought
that was very...

1025
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,930
...classy of you.

1026
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,564
- Really?
- Sure.

1027
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,006
Thanks.

1028
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,204
Did you ever notice how Callahan never
asks Warner to bring him his coffee?

1029
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,807
I mean, he's asked me
at least ten times.

1030
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,329
Well, men are helpless. You know that.

1031
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,802
I know.
Warner doesn't do his own laundry.

1032
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,521
- I know. He has to have it sent out.
- (laughing) I know.

1033
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,368
Did you know, when he first applied...

1034
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,842
- ...he got wait-listed?
- What?

1035
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,808
His father had to make a call.

1036
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,762
- You're kidding.
- Mm-mm!

1037
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,927
(Elle laughing) No way!

1038
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,287
Oh, God.
That is such a precious dog. Hi.

1039
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,568
His name is Bruiser.
Do you wanna hold him?

1040
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,363
- He's very friendly.
- Sure.

1041
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,888
Look, he likes you.

1042
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,042
Oh, he's giving me kisses.

1043
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,161
(man) Thanks, Jeff.

1044
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,971
We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.

1045
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,600
You may remember, she's charged
with the murder of her husband,

1046
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,286
Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham.

1047
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,649
First to testify are the victim's
daughter and ex-wife.

1048
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,326
(man) Superior Court
of Suffolk County is now in session.

1049
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,642
The Honorable Judge
Marina R. Bickford presiding.

1050
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,245
You may be seated.

1051
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,843
And where was she exactly?

1052
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,480
Standing over my father's dead body.

1053
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,283
And what was the defendant doing?

1054
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,324
She was sitting
next to the pool, topless...

1055
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,648
...while the Latin boy
handed her a drink.

1056
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,088
Mr. Salvatore,
can you tell us what this is?

1057
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,881
My uniform.

1058
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,242
This is the uniform

1059
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,450
that Mrs. Windham asked you
to wear while cleaning her pool?

1060
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,521
YES.

1061
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,763
And are you, or are you not,
having an affair with Brooke Windham?

1062
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,521
Define "affair."

1063
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,725
Have you and Mrs. Windham
had sexual relations?

1064
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,724
Yes. OK? Yes.

1065
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:59,201
Ladies and gentlemen, court will
reconvene tomorrow morning at 9 am.

1066
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,890
We're adjourned.

1067
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,050
You know a Delta Nu
would never sleep with a man

1068
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,730
- who wears a thong.
- Never!

1069
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,723
I just liked watching him
clean the filter.

1070
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,362
I know. I believe you, Brooke.

1071
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,966
- Take care of me, Elle.
- I will.

1072
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,171
(soul music playing)

1073
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,570
I got a big one for you.

1074
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,091
Can you sign?

1075
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,641
I got it.

1076
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,564
(grunts)

1077
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,164
- You broke his nose?
- (Paulette) Oh, I blew it, Elle.

1078
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,402
My snap was all over the place.

1079
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,962
I'll be there when court is out.
We have to cross-examine Enrique.

1080
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,804
But my girlfriend, Serena,
once barfed on a guy

1081
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,526
during The Blair Witch Project, and
they ended up dating for three months.

1082
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,889
- Really? All right. Bye-bye.
- OK, bye.

1083
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,771
Don't stomp your little
last-season Prada shoes at me, honey.

1084
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,725
They're not last season.

1085
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,325
(93595)

1086
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,851
Emmett.

1087
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,162
He's gay. Enrique is gay.

1088
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,481
What?

1089
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,927
Warner, what kind of shoes are these?

1090
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,441
- (clears throat) Black ones.
- See?

1091
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,888
- What are you talking about?
- He's gay. He isn't Brooke's lover.

1092
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,202
- He's making it up.
- (Emmett) Wait. Back up.

1093
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,011
- How do you know that he's gay?
- Gay men know designers.

1094
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,561
- Straight men don't.
- You know what?

1095
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,922
He did leave a Cher tape
in the pool house one time.

1096
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,401
While I appreciate
your masterful legal theory,

1097
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,523
I have a murder trial to attend to.

1098
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,769
- Emmett.
- OK.

1099
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,888
- I'll take care of it. Thanks.
- OK.

1100
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,610
(man) Court will come to order.

1101
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,731
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof

1102
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,885
that you and Mrs. Windham
were having an affair?

1103
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,124
Only the love in my heart.

1104
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,768
Well, if that's all the proof that he
has, Your Honor, I think I'm done here.

1105
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,320
- You may step down.
- I'd like to ask a couple of questions.

1106
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,322
Just give me a couple of minutes.

1107
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,802
Did you ever take
Mrs. Windham on a date?

1108
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,890
- Yes.
- Where?

1109
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,691
A restaurant in Concord,
where no one could recognize us.

1110
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,763
How long have you been
sleeping with Mrs. Windham?

1111
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,490
- Three months.
- And your boyfriend's name is?

1112
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,971
- Chuck.
- Right.

1113
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,367
(all gasping)

1114
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,371
Silence! Silence!

1115
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,761
- Pardon... Pardon me.
- Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

1116
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,086
I was confused.

1117
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,164
I thought you said "friend,"
Chuck is just a friend.

1118
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,800
- Oh, OK.
- You bitch!

1119
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,121
- (all exclaiming)
- (gavel rapping)

1120
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,566
Chuck, wait!

1121
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,726
Silence in my court.
Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

1122
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,087
Silence in my courtroom!

1123
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,290
(woman) How did I miss that?

1124
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,849
(Bickford) Silence in my courtroom.

1125
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,171
- Thanks.
- Wow.

1126
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,730
- Good night.
- Good night.

1127
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,529
Oh, Elle. Callahan asked
to see you before you leave.

1128
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,489
- Really?
- Yeah, you know, he has his coffee,

1129
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,130
but maybe he needs a donut.

1130
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,247
(both laughing)

1131
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,209
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

1132
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,805
OK. Bye.

1133
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,211
Come on in.

1134
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

1135
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,448
- Sit down.
- OK.

1136
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,686
Is everything all right?

1137
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,968
You followed your intuition today,
and you were right on target.

1138
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,928
- I should have listened.
- Thank you.

1139
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,482
- About the alibi.
- I'm sorry...

1140
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,689
I'm impressed that you took
the initiative to go there and get it.

1141
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,725
That's what makes a good lawyer.

1142
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,530
On top of that, you gained
the client's trust and kept it.

1143
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,409
That's what makes a great lawyer.

1144
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,050
You're smart, Elle.

1145
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,087
Smarter than most
of the guys on my payroll.

1146
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,086
Wow.

1147
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,647
I think it's time
to discuss your career path.

1148
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,486
Have you thought about
where you might be a summer associate?

1149
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,320
Oh... not really.
I know it's very competitive.

1150
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,563
Well, you know what
competition’s really about, don’t you?

1151
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:44,161
It's about ferocity. Carnage.

1152
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,488
Balancing human intelligence
with animal diligence.

1153
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,085
Knowing exactly what you want...

1154
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,205
...and how far you'll go to get it.

1155
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,768
How far will Elle go?

1156
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,243
- Are you hitting on me?
- You're a beautiful girl.

1157
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,846
- So everything you just said...
- I'm a man who knows what he wants.

1158
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,050
And I'm a law student who just realized
her professor is a pathetic asshole.

1159
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,642
Too bad. I thought you were
a law student who wanted to be a lawyer.

1160
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,604
(elevator dings)

1161
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,408
- You almost had me fooled.
- What?

1162
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,723
Maybe you should sleep
with the jury too.

1163
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,564
Then we can win the case.

1164
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,402
- Hey.
- I'm quitting.

1165
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,321
- Why?
- Law school was a mistake.

1166
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,891
This whole internship was a mistake!

1167
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,730
What are you talking about?
You earned it.

1168
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,400
I didn't earn anything, Emmett.

1169
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,167
Callahan only gave me that internship
because he liked the way I looked.

1170
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,607
Which he made clear tonight
when he tried to feel me up.

1171
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,088
Callahan did what?

1172
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,208
Just forget it.
I'm going back to LA.

1173
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,169
No more boring suits,
no more pantyhose.

1174
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,607
No more trying
to be something that I'm just...

1175
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,806
....I'm just not.

1176
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,521
What if you're trying
to be somebody you are?

1177
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,042
I mean, the hell with Callahan.

1178
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,205
Stay.

1179
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,127
Call me if you're
ever in California, OK?

1180
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,571
What's the point
in staying, Paulette? I mean...

1181
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,046
All people see when they look at me
is blonde hair and big boobs.

1182
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,089
No one's ever gonna take me seriously.

1183
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,289
People at law school don't.
And Warner doesn't.

1184
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,285
I don't even think
my own parents take me seriously.

1185
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,609
It just felt like, for the first time,
that someone expected me to...

1186
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,604
...to do something more with my life

1187
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,730
than just become
a Victoria's Secret model.

1188
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,050
But I was just kidding myself.

1189
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,963
Callahan never saw me as a lawyer,
he just saw me as a piece of ass.

1190
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,449
Just like everybody else.

1191
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,763
Turns out I am a joke.

1192
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,410
No, you're not a joke.

1193
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,771
(sniffling)

1194
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,162
The hell with law school.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1195
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,365
If you're going to let
one stupid prick ruin your life...

1196
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,961
....you're not the girl
I thought you were.

1197
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,126
(door opens, closes)

1198
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,482
(man) Did you go in there knowing how

1199
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,369
you were going
to discredit Mr. Salvatore?

1200
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:49,242
Absolutely. it's a little thing
I like to call "strategy. ”

1201
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,482
You know, I had a feeling...

1202
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,731
Is he always such an ass?

1203
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,087
He's the top defense attorney
in the state.

1204
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,287
Of course he's an ass.

1205
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,886
Fine, but is he an ass
that's gonna win my case?

1206
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,883
Well, he's an ass that's gonna try.

1207
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,283
- He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
- That's not what's important.

1208
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:09,046
If he doesn't trust me,
why should I trust him?

1209
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,329
Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy
with him last night.

1210
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,881
No. You don't even know what
the hell you're talking about.

1211
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,651
What's going on here?

1212
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,729
- Elle quit.
- What?

1213
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,531
Yeah. Callahan hit on her, so she quit.

1214
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,443
Oh, my God. Scumbag.

1215
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,480
- Oh, God.
- What?

1216
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,805
I feel terrible. I made a huge mistake.

1217
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,567
Well, maybe there's something
we can do about it.

1218
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,366
Thank you.

1219
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,966
What are you so happy about?
You're on trial for murder.

1220
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,451
Get up.

1221
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,201
- What?
- You're fired.

1222
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,164
I have new representation.

1223
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,247
Who?

1224
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,809
- Excuse you. You're in my way.
- She's a student. She can't defend you.

1225
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,568
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court Ruling 3.03.

1226
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:41,881
See?

1227
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,600
- Thank you, David.
- Counselors, approach the bench.

1228
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,727
- You're not going up there.
- Oh, yes, I am.

1229
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,724
I'm sorry. Maybe you
didn't hear me. You're fired.

1230
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,527
Counselors, now! All of you.

1231
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,485
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1232
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,326
Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court
states that a law student

1233
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,881
may appear on behalf
of a defendant in criminal proceedings

1234
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,407
Your Honor,
I have no problem with this.

1235
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,882
- I do. I'm not allowing it.
- But you agreed last night.

1236
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,247
In your office,
when we were discussing my career?

1237
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,845
The ruling also states that you need
a licensed attorney to supervise you.

1238
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,049
- Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to.

1239
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,567
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

1240
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,080
Well, then, Ms. Woods, proceed.

1241
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,204
Thank you, Your Honor.

1242
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,809
(chuckling)

1243
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,291
- Hi.
- Hi.

1244
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,731
Enjoy prison.

1245
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,680
Mrs. Windham,
you do realize what you're doing?

1246
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,171
Absolutely.

1247
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:04,522
- Oh, my God. There she is. Elle!
- Elle, we came to see your trial.

1248
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,527
Oh, look, how cute! There's, like,
a judge and everything. And jury people.

1249
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,211
- Vote for Elle!
- Ladies, take a seat.

1250
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,288
Go, girl.

1251
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,523
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1252
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,364
- I do.
- Be seated.

1253
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,801
Ms. Woods, you may
begin your questioning.

1254
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,491
First of all, I would like
to point out that,

1255
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,523
not only is there
no proof in this case,

1256
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,930
but there's a complete
lack of mens rea,

1257
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,801
which, by definition,
tells us that there can be no crime

1258
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,167
without a... vicious will.

1259
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,925
I am aware of the meaning of mens rea.

1260
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,562
What I'm unaware of is why
you're giving me a vocabulary lesson

1261
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,166
when you should be
questioning your witness.

1262
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,930
Yes, Your Honor.

1263
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,566
Ms. Windham...

1264
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,408
When you arrived back at the house...

1265
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,966
...was your father there?

1266
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,762
Not that I saw. But like I said,

1267
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,127
I went straight upstairs
to take a shower.

1268
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,803
And... when you came downstairs,
what happened?

1269
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,443
I saw Brooke standing over his body...

1270
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,042
...drenched in his blood.

1271
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:41,322
- But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
- No, she'd stashed it by then.

1272
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,289
Move to strike that
from the record, Your Honor.

1273
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,442
- It's speculation.
- So stricken.

1274
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,241
Go ahead.

1275
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,410
Ms. Windham, did you hear a shot fired?

1276
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,883
No. I was in the shower.

1277
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,361
OK.

1278
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,127
So... sometime in the 20 minutes

1279
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,964
that you were in the shower...

1280
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,961
...your father was shot?

1281
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,801
I guess.

1282
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,930
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower...

1283
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,683
...but you didn't
hear the shot because...

1284
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,443
...because you were in the shower?

1285
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:30,480
Yes. I was washing my hair.

1286
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,410
- (barks)
' (93595)

1287
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:37,246
- Where is she going with this?
- Have a little faith, Gerard.

1288
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:49,566
Ms. Windham,
what had you done earlier that day?

1289
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,006
I got up, got a latte,

1290
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,289
went to the gym,
got a perm and came home.

1291
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,887
Where you got in the shower?

1292
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,764
I believe the witness has made it
clear that she was "in the shower."

1293
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,207
(all chuckling)

1294
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,689
Yes, Your Honor.

1295
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,447
Ms. Windham,
had you ever gotten a perm before?

1296
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,850
- Yes.
- How many, would you say?

1297
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,201
Two a year since I was 12.

1298
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,411
You do the math.

1299
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,409
You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1300
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,809
We all tried to talk her out of it.
Curls weren't a good look for her.

1301
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,930
She didn't have your bone structure.

1302
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,081
Aww.

1303
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,561
But thankfully, that same day,

1304
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,722
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet T-shirt contest,

1305
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,723
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

1306
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,850
Objection! Why is this relevant?

1307
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,129
- I have a point. I promise.
- Then make it.

1308
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,570
Yes, ma'am.

1309
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:57,006
Chutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's
curls ruined when she got hosed down?

1310
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,649
- Because they got wet.
- Exactly.

1311
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,411
Because isn't it the first cardinal
rule of perm maintenance

1312
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,767
that you're forbidden
to wet your hair for at least 24 hours

1313
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,888
after getting a perm
at the risk of deactivating

1314
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:12,170
-the ammonium thioglycolate?
- Yes...

1315
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,449
And wouldn't somebody who's had,
say 30 perms before in their life

1316
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,602
be well aware of this rule?

1317
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,650
And if you weren't washing your hair,
as I suspect you weren't,

1318
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,009
because your curls are still intact,
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

1319
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:26,811
And if, in fact, you had heard the
gunshot, Brooke Windham

1320
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,964
wouldn't have had time to hide
the gun before you got downstairs,

1321
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,845
which would mean that you would've
had to have found Mrs. Windham

1322
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,522
with a gun in her hand to make
your story plausible. Isn't that right?

1323
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,047
She's my age, did she tell you that?

1324
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,521
How would you feel if your father
married someone your age?

1325
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,206
You, however, had time to hide the gun,
didn't you, Chutney?

1326
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,840
- After you shot your father.
- I didn't mean to shoot him!

1327
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,207
I thought it was you
walking through the door!

1328
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,328
(crowd exclaiming)

1329
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,882
Order! Order! Order.

1330
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,841
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1331
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,809
Oh, my God.

1332
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,688
Bailiff, take the witness into custody,

1333
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,969
where she will be charged
for the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1334
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,406
In the matter of
The State v. Brooke Windham,

1335
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,244
this case is dismissed.

1336
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,482
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

1337
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,641
Yes!

1338
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,371
(all cheering)

1339
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,408
- How did you know Chutney was lying?
- Because she's brilliant, of course.

1340
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,602
The rules of hair care
are simple and finite.

1341
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,489
Any Cosmo girl would've known.

1342
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,600
Elle! Elle. Elle. Elle.

1343
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,521
What?

1344
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,160
I just wanted to say that you were...

1345
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,810
...so brilliant in there.

1346
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,644
And that... I was wrong.

1347
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:01,166
And... you are the girl for me.

1348
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,845
- Really?
- Yes.

1349
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,446
Pooh Bear...

1350
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,005
...I love you.

1351
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,525
Oh, Warner.

1352
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,885
I've waited so long
to hear you say that.

1353
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,766
But if I'm gonna be a partner in
a law firm by the time I'm 30,

1354
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,571
I need a boyfriend who's
not such a complete bonehead.

1355
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,442
Thank you, boys.

1356
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,568
(Stromwell) Ladies and gentlemen,
I present the graduates

1357
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,129
of Harvard Law School. Class of 2004.

1358
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,921
I am personally very honored

1359
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:50,801
to introduce this year's
class-elected speaker.

01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,489
After getting off to a quite
interesting start here at Harvard,

1361
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,127
she graduates today
with an invitation to join

1362
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,841
one of Boston's
most prestigious law firms.

1363
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:07,530
I am sure we are going
to see great things from her.

1364
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:11,605
Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.

1365
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,287
(applause cheering)

1366
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,847
On our very first day at Harvard,
a very wise professor quoted Aristotle.

1367
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:42,164
"The law is reason free from passion."

1368
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,283
Well, no offense to Aristotle,
but in my three years at Harvard,

1369
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,927
I have come to find
that passion is a key ingredient

1370
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:55,130
to the study and practice
of law... and of life.

1371
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,642
It is with passion, courage of
conviction, and strong sense of self

1372
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,724
that we take our next
steps into the world,

1373
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,168
remembering that first
impressions are not always correct.

1374
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,287
You must always have faith in people...

1375
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,162
...and most importantly...

1376
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,731
...you must always
have faith in yourself.

1377
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:24,484
Congratulations, class of 2004.

1378
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,611
We did it!

1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,276
Long ago, in the faraway land
of ancient Greece...

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,039
there was a golden age
of powerful gods...

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,754
and extraordinary heroes.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,758
And the greatest and strongest
of all these heroes...

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,519
was the mighty Hercules.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,234
But what is the measure
of a true hero?

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,396
Ah, that is what our story is--

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,839
Will you listen to him?

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,758
He's makin' the story
sound like some Greek tragedy.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,279
Lighten up, dude.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,311
We'll take it from here, darling.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,237
You go, girl.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,631
We are the muses...

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,230
goddesses of the arts
and proclaimers of heroes.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,998
Heroes like Hercules.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,951
Honey, you mean ''Hunk-ules.''

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,230
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him--

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,954
Our story actually begins...

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,071
long before Hercules...

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,191
many eons ago.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,799
Ah

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,718
Back when the world was new

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,434
- Whoa!
- The planet Earth was down on its luck

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,590
And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,473
It was a nasty place

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,114
There was a mess
wherever ya stepped

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,711
Where chaos reigned and earthquakes
and volcanoes never slept

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,273
Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,799
And then along came Zeus

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,639
- He hurled his thunderbolt
- He zapped

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,036
- Locked those suckers in a vault
- They're trapped

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,755
And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,313
And that's the gospel truth

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,718
The guy was too ''Type A ''
to just relax

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,593
- And that's the world's first dish
- Yeah, baby.

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,598
Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,280
Though, honey
it may seem impossible

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,472
That's the gospel truth

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,795
On Mount Olympus life was neat

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,070
And smooth as sweet vermouth

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,997
Although, honey
it may seem impossible

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,229
That's the gospel truth

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,035
- Ah, ah
- Ah

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,039
- Ah, ah
- Oh, yeah, yeah

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,914
- Ah, ah
- Hey, hey, hey

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,919
- Ah, ah
- Hey, yeah

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,991
Hercules!

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,077
Behave yourself.

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,551
Oh, look at this.

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,113
Look how cute he is.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,434
Hah! Oh, he's strong...

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,391
like his dad, hmm?

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,317
Whoa! Excuse me!
Hot stuff coming through!

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,476
Excuse me.
One side, Ares.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,993
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,315
Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus
do the arrangement.

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,715
Isn't that too nutty?

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,559
Fabulous party. You know, I haven't
seen this much love in a room...

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,989
since Narcissus discovered himself.

60
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,754
Dear, keep those
away from the baby.

61
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,916
Oh, he won't hurt himself.

62
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,349
Let the kid have a little fun.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,078
On behalf of my son,
I want to thank you all...

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,998
for your wonderful gifts!

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,712
What about our gift, dear?

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,798
Well, let's see here.
We'll take-- Hmm, yes.

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,277
A little cirrus and, uh, hmm,
a touch of nimbostratus...

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,710
and a dash of cumulus.

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,551
His name is Pegasus...

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,478
and he's all yours, son.

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,353
Mind his head.

72
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,232
He's so tiny.

73
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,197
My boy.

74
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,959
My little Hercules.

75
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,433
How sentimental.

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,035
You know, I haven't been
this choked up...

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,833
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat!

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,190
Huh?

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,117
So is this an audience
or a mosaic?

80
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,515
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,074
So, Hades,
you finally made it.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,872
How are things
in the underworld?

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,673
Well, they're just fine. You know,
a little dark, a little gloomy.

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,916
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,032
What are you gonna do? Ah!
There's the little sunspot.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,948
Little snootchie. And here is a sucker
for the little sucker.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,718
Eh? Here you go.
You just--

88
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,753
Sheesh!

89
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,950
Uh, powerful little tyke.

90
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,356
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,789
Hey. Love to, babe...

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,593
but unlike you gods
lounging about up here...

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,995
I regrettably
have a full-time gig...

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,476
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,797
So, can't.
Love to, but can't.

96
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,469
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,353
Hah! Work yourself to death!

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,039
Oh, I kill myself!

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,633
If only. If only.

100
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,912
If there's one god you don't want
to get steamed up, it's Hades.

101
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,508
'Cause he had an evil plan.

102
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,952
He ran the underworld

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,709
But thought the dead
were dull and uncouth

104
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,037
He was as mean
as he was ruthless

105
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,914
And that's the gospel truth

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,511
He had a plan
to shake things up

107
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:31,639
And that's the gospel truth

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,792
Pain!

109
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,753
Coming,
your most lugubriousness. Ow!

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,430
- Panic!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I can handle it!

111
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,394
- Pain! Oh!
- And Panic!

112
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,476
Reporting for duty!

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,797
Fine, fine, fine.Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,592
Oh. They're here.

115
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,951
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

116
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,875
We are worms!
Worthless worms!

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,390
Memo to me, memo to me:
maim you after my meeting.

118
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,429
Darling, hold that mortal's
thread of life...

119
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,835
good and tight.

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,713
Incoming!

121
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,635
Ladies.
I am so sorry that I'm--

122
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,716
- Late!
- We knew you would be.

123
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,876
We know everything.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,036
- Past.
- Present.

125
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,991
And future.

126
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,918
Indoor plumbing.
It's gonna be big.

127
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,474
Great, gr-- Anyway, see, ladies, I
was at this party and I lost track of--

128
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,275
- We know!
- Yeah. I know you know.

129
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,312
So here's the deal. Zeus--

130
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,194
Mr High and Mighty, Mr ''Hey, You,
Get Off Of My Cloud,''-- now he has--

131
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,392
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

132
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,159
I know you know!
I know. I got it.

133
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,555
I got the concept.
So let me just ask:

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,638
is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?

135
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,149
- What do you think?
- Oh, no you don't.

136
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,477
We're not supposed
to reveal the future.

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,078
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Time out. Can I--

138
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,872
Can I ask you a question by the way?
Are you--

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,230
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.

140
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,635
I mean, you look like a Fate
worse than death.

141
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,232
Oh, gross!

142
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,351
Yech! It's blinkin'!

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,915
Ladies, please.
My fate...

144
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,076
is in your lovely hands.

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,760
- Oh.
- Oh, all right.

146
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,792
In 1 8 years precisely...

147
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,309
the planets will align...

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,477
ever so nicely.

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,669
Ay, verse. Oy.

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,268
The time to act
will be at hand.

151
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,473
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.

152
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,919
Mm-hmm. Good, good.

153
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,114
Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall...

154
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,118
and you, Hades...

155
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,152
will rule all!

156
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,748
Yes! Hades rules!

157
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,919
- A word of caution to this tale.
- Excuse me?

158
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,511
Should Hercules fight,
you will fail.

159
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,236
What?

160
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,999
Okay, fine, fine.
I'm cool. I'm fine.

161
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,030
Pain? Panic?
Got a little riddle for ya.

162
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,197
How do you kill a god?

163
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,878
I do not know!

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,592
You can't. They're immortal?

165
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,358
Bingo! They're immortal!

166
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,951
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot...

167
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,877
mortal.

168
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,834
- Huh?
- Wha-- What is it?

169
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,712
The baby!

170
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,953
Hercules! Oh!

171
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,678
No!

172
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,199
Now we did it!

173
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,356
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!

174
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,550
Just hang on to the kid, Panic!

175
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,312
Hurry! Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?

176
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,477
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,709
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?

178
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,877
No, no, no. He has to drink
the whole potion.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,992
- Every last drop!
- Who's there?

180
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,510
Alcmene, over here.

181
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,438
Oh, you poor thing.

182
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,391
- Oh, don't cry.
- Is anybody there?

183
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,670
- Now?
- Now.

184
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,952
Oh. Well, he must
have been abandoned.

185
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,514
Amphitryon, for so many years...

186
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,791
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

187
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,115
Perhaps they've answered
our prayers.

188
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,719
Perhaps they have.

189
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,671
''Hercules''?

190
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,550
Help, help, help!

191
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,875
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,514
You mean, if he finds out.

193
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,949
Of course he's gonna f--

194
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,878
If. If is good.

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,396
It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.

196
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,274
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.

197
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,871
- Young Herc was mortal now
- Mmm

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,436
But since he did not drink
the last drop

199
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,552
He still retained
his godlike strength

200
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,071
- So thank his lucky stars
- Tell it, girl.

201
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,876
- But Zeus and Hera wept
- Ooh, ooh, ooh

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,515
Because their son
could never come home

203
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,154
They'd have to watch
their precious baby

204
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,114
Grow up from afar

205
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,995
Though Hades'horrid plan

206
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,237
Was hatched before Herc
cut his first tooth

207
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,399
- Ahh
- The boy grew stronger every day

208
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,513
And that's the gospel truth

209
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:30,194
The gospel truth

210
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,430
Hercules, slow down!

211
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,196
Look out!

212
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,958
Oops! S-S-Sorry, guys!

213
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,196
- Hey, watch where you're goin'!
- Sunday driver!

214
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,118
Thanks, son.

215
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,755
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.

216
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,997
- No problem, Pop.
- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.

217
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,951
First, I have to finagle
with Phideas.

218
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,399
Okay.

219
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,476
Oops. Sorry, Penelope.

220
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,751
Now, Hercules, this time,
please just--

221
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,950
I know, I know.

222
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,389
Stay by the cart.

223
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,317
That's my boy.

224
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,759
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

225
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,518
Careful!

226
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,909
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

227
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,237
Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!

228
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,875
- Let me, let me help you with that.
- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!

229
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,911
I'm fine.
You just run along.

230
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,678
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

231
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,631
Absolutely.

232
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,430
Yo! Give it here!

233
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,391
Hey, you need an extra guy?

234
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,676
Uh, sorry, Herc.

235
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,268
Uh, we already got five...

236
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,118
and we want to keep it
an even number.

237
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,515
- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev--
- See ya, Herc.

238
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,200
- What a geek!
- Destructo Boy.

239
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,834
- Maybe we should call him ''Jerkules.''
- Yeah!

240
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,913
Heads up!

241
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,917
- I-I got it!
- No! Stop!

242
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,998
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

243
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,713
It's okay.

244
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,351
Hey! Whoa!

245
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,793
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

246
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,673
Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

247
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,189
No, no, no, no, no, no!

248
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,078
Watch out!

249
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,991
Nice catch,Jerkules.

250
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,793
Son.

251
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,710
This is the last straw,
Amphitryon!

252
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,319
That boy is a menace!

253
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,238
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

254
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,915
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

255
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,874
He-He just can't control
his strength.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,152
I'm warning you.
You keep that-that-that...

257
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,838
freak away from here!

258
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,110
Freak! Yeah, go away!

259
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,993
Son, you shouldn't let those things
they said back there get to ya.

260
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,634
But, Pop, they're right.
I-I am a freak.

261
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,877
I-I try to fit in.
I really do.

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,558
I just can't.

263
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,190
Sometimes I feel like...

264
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,959
like I really
don't belong here...

265
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,710
like I'm supposed to be
someplace else.

266
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,831
Hercules, son--

267
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,757
I know it doesn't make any sense.

268
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,760
I have often dreamed

269
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,030
Of a far-off place

270
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,473
Where a great, warm welcome
will be waiting for me

271
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,716
Where the crowds will cheer

272
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,400
When they see my face

273
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,913
And a voice keeps sayin'
this is where I'm meant to be

274
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,554
I will find my way

275
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,636
I can go the distance

276
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,638
I'll be there someday

277
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,955
If I can be strong

278
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,435
I know every mile

279
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,199
Will be worth my while

280
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,993
I would go most anywhere
to feel like I

281
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,113
Belong

282
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,232
Hercules, there's something
your mother and I...

283
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,955
have been meaning to, to tell ya.

284
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,959
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?

285
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,435
Why was I left here?

286
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,951
This was around your neck
when we found you.

287
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,037
It's the symbol of the gods.

288
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,596
This is it! Don't you see?
Maybe they have the answers.

289
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,790
I'll go to the temple of Zeus and--

290
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,551
Ma, Pop...

291
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,037
you're the greatest parents
anyone could have, but...

292
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,957
I-I gotta know.

293
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,479
I am on my way

294
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,556
I can go the distance

295
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,194
I don't care how far

296
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,515
Somehow, I'll be strong

297
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,835
I know every mile

298
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,396
Will be worth my while

299
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,353
I would go most anywhere

300
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,112
To find where I belong

301
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,431
Oh, mighty Zeus...

302
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,633
please, hear me
and, and answer my prayer.

303
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,752
I need to know:
Who am I?

304
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,269
Wh-Where do I belong?

305
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,911
Huh?

306
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,272
My boy.
My little Hercules.

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,150
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on, kiddo!

308
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,430
What's your hurry?
After all these years...

309
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,916
is this the kind of hello
you give your father?

310
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,598
F-F-Father?

311
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,598
Didn't know you had
a famous father, did you?

312
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,517
Surprise!

313
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,556
Look how you've grown.

314
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,240
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes...

315
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,430
and my strong chin.

316
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,313
- Hah!
- I-I don't understand.

317
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,194
If you're my father,
that would make me a--

318
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,673
A god.

319
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,234
A god. A god!

320
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,749
Hey, you wanted answers,
and by thunder...

321
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,394
you're old enough now
to know the truth.

322
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,990
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?

323
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,557
Of course we did. Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.

324
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,116
But someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal...

325
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,391
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.

326
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,953
And you can't do a thing?

327
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,991
I can't, Hercules,
but you can.

328
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,032
R-Really? W-What?
I'll do anything.

329
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,277
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth...

330
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,311
your godhood
will be restored.

331
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,193
A true hero. Great!

332
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,630
Uh, exactly how do you become
a true hero?

333
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,992
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

334
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,839
Seek out Philoctetes.
Right. I'll--

335
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,996
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Hold your horses!

336
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,917
Which reminds me.

337
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,877
Ha-ha! You probably
don't remember Pegasus...

338
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,514
but you two go way back, son.

339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,911
Oh, Pegasus!

340
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,917
He's a magnificent horse...

341
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,395
with the brain of a bird.

342
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,713
I'll find Philoctetes,
become a true hero!

343
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,068
That's the spirit!

344
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,352
I won't let you down, Father!
Yee-hah!

345
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,471
Good luck, son.

346
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,549
I will beat the odds

347
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,477
I can go the distance

348
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,795
I will face the world

349
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,831
Fearless, proud and strong

350
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,155
I will please the gods

351
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,077
I can go the distance

352
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,589
Till I find my hero's welcome

353
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,757
Right where I

354
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:11,031
Belong

355
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,112
Whoa!

356
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,435
Y-You sure
this is the right place?

357
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,997
W-What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?

358
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,159
- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!
- Ugh!

359
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,714
Girls! Stop! Stop!
Come back! Come back, come back!

360
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,718
Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!

361
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,355
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, nymphs!

362
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,074
- They can't keep their hands off me.
- Hey!

363
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,071
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?

364
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,760
Uh, no.
Can you help us?

365
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,431
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

366
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,357
- Call me Phil.
- Phil!

367
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,755
- Ow!
- Boy, am I glad to meet you!

368
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,917
I'm Hercules,
and this is Pegasus.

369
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,160
Animals. Disgusting.

370
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,397
I need your help.
I want to become a hero, a true hero.

371
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,236
Sorry, kid.
Can't help ya.

372
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,032
- Wait.
- Whoo!

373
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,037
Uh, sorry. Why not?

374
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,516
Two words: I am retired.

375
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,352
Look, I gotta do this.

376
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,277
Haven't you ever had a dream...

377
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,914
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

378
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,637
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you somethin'.

379
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,638
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.

380
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,352
- The Argo?
- Yeah.

381
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,870
Who do you think taught Jason
how to sail? Cleopatra?

382
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,355
I trained
all those would-be heroes.

383
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,076
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of ''yeuseus.''

384
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,634
And every single one
of those bums let me down...

385
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,478
flatter than a discus.

386
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,433
None of'em
could go the distance.

387
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,279
And then there was Achilles.

388
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,197
Now there was a guy
who had it all--

389
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,117
the build, the foot speed.

390
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,117
He could jab.
He could take a hit.

391
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,549
He could keep on comin'.

392
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,148
But that furshlugginer
heel of his!

393
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,910
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom! He's history.

394
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,632
Yeah, I had a dream once.

395
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,036
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.

396
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,153
So great, the gods would hang
a picture of him in the stars...

397
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,759
all across the sky...

398
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,395
and people would say,
''That's Phil's boy.''

399
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,397
That's right.

400
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,351
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.

401
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,311
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

402
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,431
But I'm different
than those other guys, Phil.

403
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,519
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show ya.

404
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,551
Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?

405
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,875
Watch this.

406
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,997
Holy Hera.

407
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,351
You know, maybe if I--
No! Snap out of it!

408
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,471
I'm too old to get mixed up
in this stuff again.

409
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,238
But if I don't become
a true hero...

410
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,272
I'll never be able
to rejoin my father Zeus.

411
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,312
Hold it.
Zeus is your father, right?

412
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,237
Uh-huh.

413
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,716
Zeus, the big guy.
He's your daddy.

414
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,628
Mr Lightning Bolts!
Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?

415
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,513
Zeus!
''Once upon a time--''

416
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,154
- It's the truth!
- Please!

417
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,670
So you wanna be a hero, kid

418
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,678
Well, whoop-de-do

419
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,756
I have been
around the block before

420
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,110
With blockheads just like you

421
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,390
Each and every one
a disappointment

422
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,876
Pain for which
there ain't no ointment

423
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,356
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus is

424
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,677
Askin'me to jump
into the fray

425
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,439
My answer is two words

426
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,719
Okay.

427
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,159
You mean you'll do it?

428
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,191
- You win.
- You won't be sorry, Phil.

429
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,515
- Oh, gods.
- So when do we start? Can we start now?

430
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,437
Oy, vay.

431
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,273
I'd given up hope
that someone would come

432
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,992
Along

433
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,350
A fella who'd ring the bell
for once

434
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,550
Not the gong

435
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,875
The kind who wins trophies

436
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,230
Won't settle for low fees

437
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,078
At least semipro fees

438
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,998
But, no
I get the greenhorn

439
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,272
I've been out to pasture, pal
My ambition gone

440
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,916
Content to spend lazy days
and to graze my lawn

441
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,315
But you need an advisor

442
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,635
A satyr, but wiser

443
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,275
A good merchandiser
and-- whoa

444
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,075
There goes my ulcer
I'm down to one last hope, and I hope

445
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,952
It's you

446
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,551
Though, kid, you're not
exactly a dream come true

447
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,750
I trained enough turkeys

448
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,110
- Who never came through
- Whoa!

449
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,754
You're my one last hope
so you'll have to do

450
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,515
Rule number six:
when rescuing a damsel...

451
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,551
always handle with care.

452
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,157
No!

453
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,073
Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!

454
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,355
Rule number 96:

455
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,471
aim!

456
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,670
Demigods have faced the odds

457
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,950
And ended up a mockery

458
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,593
Don't believe the stories

459
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,951
That you read
on all the crockery

460
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,278
To be a true hero, kid
is a dyin'art

461
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,868
Like paintin'a masterpiece

462
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,911
It's a work of heart

463
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,156
It takes more than sinew

464
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,589
Comes down to what's in you

465
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,235
You have to continue to grow

466
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,351
Now that's more like it!

467
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,835
I'm down to one last shot

468
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,509
And my last high note

469
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,634
Before that blasted underworld
gets my goat

470
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,478
My dreams are on you, kid

471
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,636
Go make 'em come true

472
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,478
Climb that uphill slope

473
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,955
Keep pushin'that envelope

474
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,718
You're my one last hope

475
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,991
And, kid, it's up to

476
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,829
You

477
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,473
Yeah!

478
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,711
Did you see that?

479
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,037
Next stop, Olympus.

480
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,991
All right.
Just take it easy, champ.

481
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,076
I am ready.
I want to get off this island.

482
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,589
I want to see battles
and monsters.

483
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,517
Rescue some damsels.

484
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,676
You know, heroic stuff.

485
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,997
- Well.
- Aw, come on, Phil!

486
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,351
Well, okay, okay.
You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.

487
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,836
- We're goin' to Thebes!
- Ya-hoo!

488
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,474
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

489
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,512
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.

490
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,553
Sounds like your basic DID--

491
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,399
- Hyah!
- Damsel in distress!

492
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,115
Not so fast, sweetheart.

493
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,515
I swear, Nessus.
Put me down or I'll--

494
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,235
Whoo!
I like 'em fiery!

495
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,193
Now remember, kid.
First, analyse the situation.

496
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,029
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking. Eh?

497
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,718
He's losin' points for this!

498
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,115
- You don't know what you're--
- Halt!

499
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,239
Step aside, two legs.

500
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,830
Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.

501
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,757
I'll have to ask you to release
that young...

502
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,553
- Keep movin', junior.
- lady.

503
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,116
But you-- Are-Aren't you
a damsel in distress?

504
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,198
I'm a damsel.
I'm in distress.

505
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,153
I can handle this.
Have a nice day.

506
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,077
Uh--

507
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,112
Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close
to the situation to realize--

508
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,116
Ohhh! What are you doin'?
Get your sword!

509
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,711
Sword. Right, right. Rule number 1 5:
a hero is only as good as his weapon!

510
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,237
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

511
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,272
Come on, kid!
Concentrate!

512
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,913
Use your head!

513
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,639
Oh.

514
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,993
All right!
Not bad, kid!

515
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,554
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

516
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,879
Oh, gee, miss.
I'm, I'm really sorry.

517
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,070
- Oh.
- That was dumb.

518
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,519
Yeah.

519
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,999
Excuse me.

520
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,357
Nice work! Excelente.

521
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,471
Is Wonderboy here for real?

522
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,388
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real. Whoa!

523
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,917
And by the way, sweet cheeks.
I'm real too.

524
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,519
Ugh!

525
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,632
Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!

526
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,272
Whoa!

527
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,357
- How was that, Phil?
- Reign it in, rookie.

528
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,233
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons...

529
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,874
but this is the big leagues!

530
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,672
At least I beat him, didn't I?

531
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,156
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!

532
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,840
D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.

533
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,679
You gotta stay focused,
and you--

534
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,712
Are you, uh, all right,
Miss, uh--

535
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,717
Megara.
My friends call me Meg.

536
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,637
At least they would
if I had any friends.

537
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,072
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?

538
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,954
Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh--

539
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,435
- Uh, uh--
- Are you always this articulate?

540
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,393
Hercules. My--
My name is Hercules.

541
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,592
Herc-- Huh.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.

542
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,713
So, uh, uh-- How-how-how'd you
get mixed up with the, uh--

543
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,195
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

544
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,074
They think ''No'' means ''Yes'' and
''Get lost'' means ''Take me. I'm yours.''

545
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,756
Don't worry. Shorty here
can explain it to ya later.

546
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,996
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.

547
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,839
It's been a real slice.

548
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,952
Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?

549
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,516
Uh, I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.

550
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,234
Pegasus? Oh, no.
Don't be silly.

551
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,999
He'd be more than happy to-- Ow!

552
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,319
I'll be all right.
I'm a big tough girl.

553
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,510
I tie my own sandals
and everything.

554
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,079
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

555
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,589
Bye.

556
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,757
She's somethin'.
Isn't she, Phil?

557
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,519
Yeah, ye-- Oh, yeah.
She's really somethin'.

558
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,598
A real pain in the patella!
Earth to Herc!

559
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,119
Come in, Herc!
Come in, Herc!

560
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,708
We got a job to do, remember?

561
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,512
Thebes is still waitin'.

562
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,949
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

563
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,672
Aw, how cute.

564
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,473
A couple of rodents
lookin' for a theme park.

565
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,272
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?

566
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,233
- I'm a bunny!
- A-And I'm his gopher!

567
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,237
Ta-dah!

568
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,555
I thought I smelled a rat.

569
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,513
- Meg.
- Speak of the devil.

570
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,553
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut. Meg.

571
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,477
What exactly happened here?

572
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,194
I thought you were gonna persuade
the river guardian to join my team...

573
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,790
for the uprising, and here I am,
kind of river guardian-less.

574
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,799
I gave it my best shot, but
he made me an offer I had to refuse.

575
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,150
Fine. So instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence...

576
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,191
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?

577
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,356
- Give that your best shot.
- Look. It wasn't my fault.

578
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,074
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

579
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,510
Hercules.
Why does that name ring a bell?

580
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,393
I don't know.
Um, maybe we owe him money?

581
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,911
- What was that name again?
- Hercules.

582
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,871
He comes on with this big,
innocent farm boy routine...

583
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,831
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

584
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,714
Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to--

585
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,037
Oh, my gods!
Run for it!

586
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,391
So you took care of him, huh?

587
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,397
Dead as a doornail.

588
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,273
Weren't those your exact words?

589
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,072
This might be
a different Hercules.

590
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,749
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!

591
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,111
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason...

592
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,719
and the girls
were all named Brittany?

593
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,277
I'm about to rearrange
the cosmos...

594
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,597
and the one schlemiel
who can louse it up...

595
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,917
is waltzing around in the woods!

596
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,792
Wait. Wait, big guy.

597
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,673
- We can still cut in on his waltzing.
- That's right.

598
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,439
And-And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.

599
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,879
Didn't we?

600
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,151
Hmm. Fortunately
for the three of you...

601
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,989
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

602
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,635
And this time, no foul-ups.

603
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,914
Wow!

604
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,430
- Is that all one town?
- One town, a million troubles.

605
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,232
The one and only Thebes.

606
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,555
The Big Olive itself.

607
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,433
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

608
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,358
Stick with me, kid.
The city is a dangerous place.

609
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,675
- Look where you're goin', numbskull!
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

610
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,030
See what I mean?
I'm tellin' you. Wackos.

611
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,357
Pita bread. Pita bread.
Get your pita bread here.

612
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,119
- Hey, Mack.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

613
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,117
You wanna buy a sundial?

614
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,196
He's not interested, all right?
Come on, kid.

615
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,357
The end is coming!
Can't you feel it?

616
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,119
Yes, yes.
Thank you for the info. Yes.

617
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,515
We'll ponder that for awhile.
Just stare at the sidewalk.

618
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,959
Come on.
Don't make eye contact.

619
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,436
People here are nuts. That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.

620
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,279
Trust me, kid. You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

621
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,118
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.

622
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,279
Everything
except old Snowball here.

623
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,960
Now were the fires
before or after the earthquake?

624
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,877
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

625
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,433
But before the flood.

626
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,632
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

627
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,309
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.

628
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,032
Tell me about it.

629
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,071
It seems like every time
I turn around...

630
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,191
there's some new monster
wreakin' havoc and I--

631
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,357
All we need now
is a plague of locusts.

632
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,513
That's it!
I'm movin' to Sparta!

633
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,995
Excuse me.

634
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,758
It, uh...

635
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,395
seems to me that
what you folks need is a hero.

636
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,511
Yeah, and who are you?

637
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,630
I'm Hercules, and, uh...

638
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,955
I happen to be a hero.

639
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,191
- Is that so?
- A hero!

640
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,515
Have you ever saved
a town before?

641
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,835
Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I--

642
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,315
Have you ever reversed
a natural disaster?

643
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,635
Well, uh, no.

644
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,469
Oh, listen to thi-- He's just another
chariot chaser. This we need.

645
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,919
That's a laugh.

646
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,395
- Don't you pea brains get it?
- Hmm?

647
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,431
This kid is the genuine article.

648
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,633
Hey, isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

649
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,273
Watch it, pal.

650
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,712
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!

651
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,274
Ya missed a spot!

652
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,436
You-- I got your heel
right here!

653
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,710
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You--

654
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,638
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil!

655
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,433
What are you, crazy? Sheesh.

656
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,030
Young man, we need
a professional hero...

657
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,515
not an amateur.

658
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,271
Well, wait. Stop!

659
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,110
How am I supposed
to prove myself a hero...

660
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,878
if nobody
will give me a chance?

661
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,319
You'll get your chance.

662
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,115
You just need some kind
of catastrophe or disaster.

663
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,710
Please. Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!

664
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,115
- Meg?
- Speakin' of disasters.

665
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,708
Wonderboy! Hercules!

666
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,592
- Thank goodness.
- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?

667
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,039
Oh! Outside of town.

668
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,310
Two little boys.
Th-They were playing in the gorge.

669
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,908
Th-There was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.

670
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,679
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

671
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,313
Phil, this is great!

672
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,237
You're really choked up
about this, aren't ya?

673
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,430
- Come on!
- No, I-- You don't under--

674
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,552
I, I have this terrible fear
of heights!

675
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,120
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!

676
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,879
I'm way behind ya, kid.

677
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,399
I got a fur wedgie.

678
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,718
- Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

679
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,876
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstery.

680
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,831
Help! I can't breathe!

681
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,837
- Hurry!
- Get us out!

682
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,315
We're suffocating!

683
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,477
Somebody call IX-I-I!

684
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,192
Easy, fellas.
You'll be all right.

685
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,878
We can't last much longer!

686
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,434
Get us out before we get crushed!

687
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,716
- How you boys doin'?
- We're okay now.

688
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,355
Jeepers, mister.
You're really strong.

689
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,870
Well, just try to be a little
more careful next time, okay, kids?

690
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,798
We sure will.

691
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,593
Stirring performance, boys.

692
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,597
I was really moved.

693
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,989
''Jeepers, mister''?

694
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,157
I was going for innocence.

695
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,068
And, hey, two thumbs way,
way up for our leading lady.

696
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,191
What a dish.
What a doll.

697
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,550
Get outta there, ya big lug,
while ya still can.

698
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,236
Phil, I-I did great.

699
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,157
They even applauded. Sort of.

700
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,870
Huh! I hate
to burst your bubble, kid...

701
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,831
but that ain't applause.

702
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,670
Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?
What do you call that thing?

703
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,189
Two words:

704
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,833
am-scray!

705
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,156
Let's get ready to rumble!

706
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,196
That's it. Dance around!
Dance around!

707
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,551
Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!
Keep going. Come on. Come on.

708
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,513
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left. Your other left!

709
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,070
Whoa!

710
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,712
All right! All right!
You're bad! Okay!

711
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,913
See, Phil?
That-- That wasn't so hard.

712
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,157
Kid, kid, kid.
How many horns do you see?

713
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,236
- Six?
- Eh, close enough.

714
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,191
Let's get you cleaned up.

715
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,876
Guys, guys, relax.
It's only halftime.

716
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,672
That doesn't sound good.

717
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,639
Definitely not good!

718
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,352
Will you forget
the head-slicing thing?

719
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,433
Phil, I don't think we covered this one
in basic training!

720
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,518
My favourite part of the game:

721
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,838
sudden death.

722
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,909
Oh. There goes another one.

723
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,156
Just like Achilles.

724
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,997
Game...

725
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,635
set, match.

726
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,556
Hmm?

727
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,553
Phil, you gotta admit.

728
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,875
That was pretty heroic.

729
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,152
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
Ya won by a landslide!

730
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,071
Hades mad.

731
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,875
Well, what do you know?

732
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,710
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

733
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,276
He was so hot,
steam looked cool.

734
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,472
Oh, yeah

735
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,068
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

736
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,998
Person of the week
in every Greek opinion poll

737
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,714
- What a pro
- Herc could stop a show

738
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,593
Point him at a monster
and you're talkin'SRO

739
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,314
- He was a no one
- A zero, zero

740
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,273
- Now he's a honcho
- He's a hero

741
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,960
Here was a kid
with his act down pat

742
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,799
Zero to hero in no time flat

743
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,480
- Zero to hero
-Just like that

744
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,353
When he smiled
the girls went wild

745
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,869
With oohs and aahs

746
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,719
And they slapped his face
on every vase

747
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,559
On every ''vahse''

748
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,148
From appearance fees
and royalties

749
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,748
Our Herc had cash to burn

750
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,519
Now nouveau riche and famous

751
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,996
He could tell you
what's a Grecian urn

752
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,759
Say amen
There he goes again

753
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,440
- Sweet and undefeated
- And an awesome ten for ten

754
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,949
Folks lined up
just to watch him flex

755
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,197
And this perfect package
packed a pair of pretty pecs

756
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,993
Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers

757
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,793
Honey, the crowds
were goin'bonkers

758
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,275
- He showed the moxie brains and spunk
- Yeah

759
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,358
- From zero to hero
- A major hunk

760
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,789
- Zero to hero
- And who'd have thunk

761
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,191
Who put the glad in gladiator

762
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,878
Hercules

763
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,309
Whose darin'deeds
are great theatre

764
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,873
Hercules

765
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,797
- Isn't he bold
- No one braver

766
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,911
- Is he sweet
- Our favourite flavour

767
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,837
- Hercules
- My man.

768
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,712
- Hercules
- Hercules

769
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,717
- Hercules
- Ooh

770
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,195
- Hercules
- Look at my Hercules

771
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,357
- Hercules, Hercules
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

772
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,630
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

773
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,149
- Undefeated
- Riding high

774
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,192
- And the nicest guy.
- Not conceited

775
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,231
- He was a nothing
- A zero, zero

776
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,112
- Now he's a honcho
- He's our hero

777
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,118
He hit the heights
at breakneck speed

778
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,390
From zero to hero

779
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,317
Herc is a hero

780
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,355
Now he's a hero

781
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,436
Yes, indeed

782
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,231
Pull!

783
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,117
Nice shootin', Rex.

784
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,198
I can't believe this guy.
I throw everything I've got at him...

785
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,675
and it doesn't even--

786
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,395
What are those?

787
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,229
Um, I don't know.
I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.

788
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,909
I've got 24 hours
to get rid of this bozo...

789
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,239
or the entire scheme I've been setting
up for 1 8 years goes up in smoke...

790
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,354
and you are wearing
his merchandise?

791
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,035
Thirsty?

792
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,439
Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy
is hitting every curve you throw at him.

793
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,357
Oh, yeah.

794
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,678
I wonder if maybe
I haven't been throwing...

795
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,999
the right curves at him,
Meg, my sweet.

796
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,917
Don't even go there.

797
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,110
See, he's gotta have
a weakness...

798
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,310
because everybody's
got a weakness.

799
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,715
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.

800
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,400
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?

801
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,114
We simply need
to find out Wonderboy's.

802
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,356
I've done my part.
Get your little imps--

803
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,232
They couldn't handle him
as a baby.

804
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,920
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.

805
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,712
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

806
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,956
Well, you know, that's good
because that's what got you...

807
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,877
into this jam in the first place,
isn't it?

808
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,231
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

809
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,749
And how does this creep thank you?

810
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,872
By running off
with some babe.

811
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,797
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?

812
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,911
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

813
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,270
Which is exactly why
I got a feelin'...

814
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,277
you're gonna leap
at my new offer.

815
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,278
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath...

816
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,836
and I give you the thing
that you crave most...

817
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,679
in the entire cosmos:

818
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,712
your freedom.

819
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,192
You should
have been there, Father.

820
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,231
I mangled the Minotaur...

821
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,920
grappled with the Gorgon.

822
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,429
Just like Phil told me.
I analysed the situation...

823
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,869
controlled my strength
and kicked.

824
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,997
The crowds went wild!

825
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,078
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hah!

826
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,988
You're doing great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

827
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,076
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Father.

828
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,395
I've been waiting
for this day a long time.

829
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,034
Hmm. What day is that, son?

830
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,118
The day I rejoin the gods.

831
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,550
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.

832
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,477
You're just not there yet.

833
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,229
You haven't proven yourself
a true hero.

834
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,557
But, Father, I've beaten every
single monster I've come up against.

835
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,797
I-I'm-I'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.

836
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,595
I'm-I-I'm an action figure!

837
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,280
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same...

838
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,631
as being a true hero.

839
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,113
What more can I do?

840
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,312
It's something you have
to discover for yourself.

841
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,558
- But how can I--
- Look inside your heart.

842
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,871
Father, wait!

843
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,111
On your left
is Hercules' villa.

844
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,435
Our next stop
is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...

845
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,552
where you can pick up the great hero's
30-minute workout scroll...

846
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,511
''Buns of Bronze.''

847
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,756
At 1 :00, you got a meeting
with King Augeas.

848
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,472
He's got a problem
with his stables.

849
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,192
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.

850
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,550
- Phil.
- I told you, don't move!

851
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,636
DGR, the Daughters
of the Greek Revolution.

852
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,228
- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.
- Phil.

853
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,238
Phil, what's the point?

854
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,519
That's it!

855
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,471
Keep your toga on, pal.

856
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,791
Yuck! What do you mean,
''What's the point?''

857
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,353
You wanna go to Olympus,
don't ya?

858
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,439
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

859
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,154
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

860
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,157
I gave this everything I had.

861
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,313
Listen to me, kid.
I seen 'em all.

862
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,353
And I am tellin' you--
and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth--

863
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,391
you got somethin'
I never seen before.

864
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,317
- Really?
- I can feel it...

865
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,874
right down in these stubby
bowlegs of mine.

866
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,878
There is nothin'
you can't do, kid.

867
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,516
- It's him!
- Hey, watch it!

868
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,914
- Watch it! Watch--
- I touched his elbow!

869
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,838
- Hey, girls!
- I got his sweatband!

870
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,110
Phil, help!

871
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,516
- Okay. Escape plan: beta.
- Gotcha.

872
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,269
- Hey! Where is he?
- There he goes! On the veranda!

873
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,231
Whoa!

874
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,591
Let's see. What could be behind
curtain number one?

875
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,278
Meg!

876
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,960
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.

877
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,594
Gee, i-i-it's
great to see you.

878
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,597
I-I-I missed you.

879
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,075
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

880
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,236
Nah. I'm no hero.

881
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,510
Sure ya are.
Everybody in Greece...

882
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,950
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pita.

883
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,197
I know, it's-- it's crazy. You know, I
can't go anywhere without being mobbed.

884
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,709
- I mean--
- You sound like you could use a break.

885
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,470
Think your nanny goat would go berserk
if you played hookey this afternoon?

886
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,717
Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got
the rest of the day pretty much booked.

887
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,671
Ah, Phil, schmill.

888
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,268
Just follow me out the window,
round the dumbbells.

889
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,994
You lift up the back wall
and we're gone.

890
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,196
Wow. What a day.

891
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,197
First that restaurant by the bay.

892
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,596
And then that, that play,
that, that, that Oedipus thing.

893
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,075
Man! I thought I had problems.

894
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,315
- Psst! Stop foolin' around.
- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.

895
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,750
I didn't know that playing hookey
could be so much fun.

896
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,394
Yeah, neither did I.

897
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,671
- Thanks, Meg.
- Oh.

898
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,836
Don't thank me just yet.

899
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,315
- Oh!
- Oop. Careful.

900
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,317
Sorry. Weak ankles.

901
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,479
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better
sit down for a while.

902
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,479
So, uh, do you
have any problems...

903
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,511
with things like this?

904
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,473
- Uh--
- Weak ankles, I mean.

905
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,319
Oh, uh, no, not really.

906
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,115
No weaknesses whatsoever?

907
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,913
- No trick knee?
- Uh--

908
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,474
Ruptured disks?

909
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,315
No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.

910
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,353
- Wonderboy, you are perfect.
- Thanks.

911
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,029
Whoops!

912
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,391
It looks better that way.

913
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,829
No, it really does.

914
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,316
You know, when, when I was a kid...

915
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,558
I, I would have given anything to be
exactly like everybody else.

916
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,114
You wanted to be
petty and dishonest?

917
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,835
- Everybody's not like that.
- Yes, they are.

918
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,111
- You're not like that.
- How do you know what I'm like?

919
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,037
All I know is...

920
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,029
you're the most amazing person with
weak ankles I've ever met.

921
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,078
Oh!

922
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,555
Meg, when I'm with you...

923
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,878
I-I don't feel so alone.

924
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,355
Sometimes it's better
to be alone.

925
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,756
- What do you mean?
- Nobody can hurt you.

926
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:30,229
Meg? I would never ever hurt you.

927
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,874
And I don't wanna
hurt you, so...

928
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,389
let's both do
ourselves a favour and...

929
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,150
stop this before we--

930
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,989
All right! Break it up!
Break it up! Party's over!

931
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,759
- I've been lookin' all over this town!
- Calm down, mutton man.

932
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,269
- It was all my fault.
- You're already on my list, sister!

933
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,470
So don't make it worse!

934
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,359
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium...

935
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,596
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!

936
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,793
- Now get on the horse.
- Okay, okay.

937
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,514
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, he'll get over it.

938
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,793
Move! Move, move,
move, move, move! Move!

939
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,709
Hey, watch it. Watch it.
Watch it.

940
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,990
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the--

941
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,198
That's it. Next time, I drive.

942
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,918
Oh, what's the matter with me?

943
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,555
You'd think a girl would learn.

944
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,832
If there's a prize
for rotten judgment

945
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,714
I guess I've already won that

946
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,152
No man is worth the aggravation

947
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,670
That's ancient history
Been there, done that

948
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,429
Who do ya think you're kidding
He's the earth and heaven to ya

949
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,791
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya

950
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,990
- Oh, no
- Girl, you can't conceal it

951
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,750
We know how you feel
and who you're thinkin'of

952
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:19,193
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

953
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,756
You swoon, you sigh
Why deny it, uh-oh

954
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,759
It's too cliche
I won't say I'm in love

955
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,316
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
Oo-oo-oo

956
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,750
I thought my heart
had learned its lesson

957
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,270
It feels so good
when you start out

958
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,678
-Ah
- My head is screaming, get a grip, girl

959
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,475
Unless you're dyin'
to cry your heart out, oh

960
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,036
You keep on denyin' who you are
and how you're feelin'

961
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,039
Baby, we're not buyin'
Hon, we saw you hit the ceilin'

962
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,516
Face it like a grownup
When you gonna own up that you

963
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,438
- Got
- Got
- Got it bad

964
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,680
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

965
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,509
- Give up, but give in
- Check the grin, you're in love

966
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,155
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love

967
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,909
You're doin'flips, read our lips
You're in love

968
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,837
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
- You're way off base

969
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,712
- I won't say it
- She won't say love

970
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,549
Get off my case
I won't say it

971
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:28,800
Girl, don't be proud
It's okay, you're in love

972
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,514
Oh

973
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,677
At least out loud

974
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,315
I won't say I'm in

975
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,159
- Love
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo, shoo-doo

976
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,352
Shoo-doo
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

977
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,596
Ha

978
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,596
Hey, what's the buzz, huh, Meg?

979
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,951
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

980
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,834
-Get yourself another girl. I'm through.
-I'm sorry. You mind runnin'
that by me again?

981
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,554
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.

982
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,719
Then read my lips! Forget it.

983
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,152
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet deluded little minion.

984
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,751
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,
but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?

985
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,677
I own you!

986
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:28,351
- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.
- You work for me.

987
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,789
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.

988
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,832
If I say, ''Sing,''
you say, ''Hey, name that tune.''

989
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,272
If I say, ''I want Wonderboy's head
on a platter,'' you say--

990
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,197
Medium or well done?

991
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,632
Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.

992
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,797
- I'll work on that.
- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

993
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,357
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.

994
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,189
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.

995
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,199
I can't believe you're getting
so worked up about some guy.

996
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,595
This one is different.
He's honest and, and he's sweet.

997
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,517
- Please!
- He would never do anything to hurt me.

998
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,236
-He's a guy.
-Besides, O Oneness, you can't beat him.

999
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,592
He has no weaknesses.
He's gonna--

1000
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,110
I think he does, Meg.

1001
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,835
I truly think he does.

1002
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,837
- Hey, Phil, what happened to you?
- Kid, we gotta talk.

1003
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,793
Oh, Phil, I just had
the greatest day of my life.

1004
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,071
I, I, I can't stop thinkin'
about Meg.

1005
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,919
- She's somethin' else.
- Kid! I'm tryin' to talk to you!

1006
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,837
Will you come down here
and listen?

1007
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,431
Aw, how can I come down there
when I'm feelin' so up?

1008
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,874
Gotcha!

1009
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,434
Ah, very nice.
What I'm tryin' to say is--

1010
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,994
That if it wasn't for you,
I never would have met her.

1011
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,315
Oh, I owe you big time,
little guy. I do.

1012
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,668
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

1013
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,234
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?

1014
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,193
- Phil, I got two words for ya: duck!
- Listen to me. She's--

1015
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,833
- My dream come true?
- Not exactly.

1016
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,791
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?
- Aside from that!

1017
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,833
- The most wonderful--
- She's a-- She's a fraud!

1018
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,349
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

1019
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,278
- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
- I'm not kiddin' around.

1020
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,197
- She--
- I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to--

1021
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,550
- Kid, you're missin' the point.
- The point is, I love her.

1022
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,272
- She don't love you.
- You're crazy.

1023
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,231
- She nothin' but a two-timin'--
- Stop it!

1024
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,590
- No-good, lyin', schemin'--
- Shut up!

1025
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,196
Phil. I-- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

1026
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,949
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.

1027
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,435
Phil, wait. Where ya goin'?

1028
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,599
I'm hoppin' the first barge outta here.
I'm goin' home.

1029
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,790
Fine! G--

1030
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,798
Go! I don't-- I don't need you.

1031
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,111
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ...

1032
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,437
not the all-time chump.

1033
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,953
Jeez Louise,
what got his goat, huh?

1034
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,637
Baboom. Name is Hades,
lord of the dead.

1035
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,671
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Uh, not now, okay?

1036
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,394
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds,
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

1037
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,114
See, I've got
this major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

1038
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,196
And, Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1039
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,595
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it, huh?

1040
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,154
- You've got the wrong guy.
- Hear me out, ya little--

1041
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,191
Just hear me out, okay?

1042
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,959
So I would be eternally grateful
if you would just...

1043
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,355
take a day off from
this hero business of yours.

1044
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,357
Jeez, I mean, monsters,
natural disasters.

1045
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,198
- You wait a day, huh?
- You're out of your mind.

1046
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,757
Not so fast, because, ya see,
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

1047
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,789
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc--

1048
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,956
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

1049
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,799
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

1050
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,990
Say, the next 24 hours.

1051
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,951
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1052
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,150
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.

1053
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,669
What do ya say? Come on.

1054
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,597
People are-- are gonna
get hurt, aren't they?

1055
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,631
Nah! I mean, it's, you know,
it's a possibility.

1056
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,557
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war,
but what can I tell ya?

1057
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,511
Anyway, what do you
owe these people, huh?

1058
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,393
Isn't Meg--
you little smoochy face you--
Isn't she more important than they are?

1059
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,397
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

1060
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,080
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

1061
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,077
Fine, okay.
I'll give you that one.

1062
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,236
Meg is safe, otherwise
you get your strength right back.

1063
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,351
Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.
Baboom. Okay? We're done.

1064
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,277
What do you say we shake on it?

1065
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,391
Hey, I really don't have,
like, time to bat this around.

1066
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,351
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

1067
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,313
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice--

1068
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,069
- All right!
- Yes! We're there! Bam!

1069
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,873
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kind of natural.

1070
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,991
Maybe you should sit down!

1071
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,755
Now you know how it feels to be
just like everybody else.

1072
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,190
Isn't it just peachy?

1073
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,515
Oh! You'll love this.
One more thing.

1074
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,200
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.

1075
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,392
You're off the hook.
And by the way, Herc,

1076
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,556
is she not, like,
a fabulous little actress?

1077
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,079
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

1078
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,193
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

1079
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,915
- Duh.
- You're-- You're lying!

1080
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,716
- Help!
-Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.

1081
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,674
- Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.
- No! It's-- It's not like that.

1082
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,510
I didn't mean to--
I-I couldn't-- I-- I'm so sorry.

1083
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,428
Our hero's a zero!
Our hero's a zero!

1084
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:14,148
Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole
cosmos up there waiting for me...

1085
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,157
with, hey, my name on it.

1086
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,114
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

1087
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,836
Brothers! Titans!

1088
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,316
Look at you in your squalid prison!

1089
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,230
- Who put you down there?
- Zeus!

1090
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,715
And now that I set you free...

1091
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,196
what is the first thing
you are going to do?

1092
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,915
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

1093
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,353
Crush Zeus!

1094
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,957
Freeze him!

1095
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,357
Melt Zeus!

1096
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,758
Blow him away!

1097
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:26,718
Zeus!

1098
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,478
- Uh, guys?
- Huh?

1099
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,273
Olympus would be that way.

1100
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,359
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

1101
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,277
- Hold it, bright eye.
- Huh?

1102
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,392
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

1103
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,035
- Huh? Huh?
- Destroy Zeus!

1104
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,789
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta--

1105
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,150
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped.

1106
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,111
And they're practically
at our gates!

1107
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:03,153
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!

1108
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,794
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

1109
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,316
Huh?

1110
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,829
- Charge!
- On to battle!

1111
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,269
Ya windbag!

1112
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,034
Boom, badda-boom!
Boom, boom!

1113
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,194
Hercules!

1114
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,471
Where are you?

1115
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,918
- What can we do?
- Where is Hercules?

1116
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,793
Yeah, Hercules will save us.

1117
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,151
Hercules!

1118
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,718
Come out! Face me!

1119
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,071
Oh, what are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.

1120
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,919
- Hercules!
- There are worse things.

1121
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,715
- Run!
- Wait! Stop!

1122
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,755
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods! We're saved!

1123
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,793
So, you mighty Hercules.

1124
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,510
- Oh!
- Oh!

1125
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,589
Easy, horsefeathers.
Whoa! Stop twitching!

1126
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,679
Listen.
Hercules is in trouble.

1127
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,633
We've gotta find Phil. He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.

1128
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,870
Get back! Blast you!

1129
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,873
- Ooh! Chihuahua!
- Zeus!

1130
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,032
Come on! Hurry up!
We're shovin' off here!

1131
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,835
Phil! Phil,
Hercules needs your help.

1132
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,235
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?

1133
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,911
- He won't listen to me.
- Good! He's finally learned somethin'.

1134
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,033
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me. It's about him.

1135
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,391
If you don't help him now,
Phil, he'll die.

1136
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,590
I need more thunderbolts!

1137
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,952
Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord. Everyone's been captured.

1138
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,595
I've been captured.
Hey, hey, watch the glasses.

1139
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,193
Zeusy, I'm home!

1140
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,995
Hades! You're behind this?

1141
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,271
You're correct, sir!

1142
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,310
Flea!

1143
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,158
- Hercules!
- Phil.

1144
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,397
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.
Come on. You can take this bum.

1145
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,230
- This guy's a pushover. Look at him.
- You were right all along, Phil.

1146
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,636
- Dreams are for rookies.
- No, no, no, no, no, kid.

1147
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,673
Givin' up is for rookies. I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.

1148
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,713
I'm willin' to go the distance.
How about you?

1149
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,918
Me bite off head!

1150
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,758
Whoa, baby!

1151
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,110
Hercules! Look out!

1152
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,152
Meg! No!

1153
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,960
What's happening?

1154
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,594
H-Hades' deal is broken.

1155
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,438
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

1156
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,475
Meg, why-- why-- why did ya--
You didn't have to--

1157
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,673
Oh, people always
do crazy things...

1158
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,234
when they're in love.

1159
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,114
Oh, Meg. Meg, I-- I--

1160
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:27,870
Are you always this articulate?

1161
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:35,040
You-- You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

1162
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,232
I'll watch over her, kid.

1163
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,353
You're gonna be all right.
I promise.

1164
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,473
Let's go, Pegasus!

1165
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,515
Hup, two, three, four!
Come on, everybody!

1166
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,234
- I can't hear you!
- Oh, oh, that.

1167
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,399
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of th--

1168
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,988
I'm the one giving orders now,
bolt boy.

1169
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,759
And I think
I'm gonna like it here.

1170
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,839
Don't get too
comfortable, Hades!

1171
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,236
- Hercules!
- This ought to even the odds!

1172
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,749
- Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.
- Get them!

1173
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,791
Whoa! Hey!

1174
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,196
No! Get him! Not me! Him!

1175
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,911
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse!

1176
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,193
- Thank you, my boy.
- Nice horsey!

1177
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,950
My intentions were pure.
I really was attracted to you.

1178
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,828
- Throw!
- Ah! Now watch your old man work!

1179
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,757
Uh-oh!

1180
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,069
Guys, get your
titanic rears in gear...

1181
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,317
and kick some Olympian butt.

1182
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,113
Whoa! Is my hair out?

1183
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,518
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize--

1184
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,872
a friend of yours
who's dying to see me.

1185
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,115
Meg.

1186
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,713
Meg.

1187
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,229
Meg, no.

1188
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,071
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

1189
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,915
There's some things
you just can't change.

1190
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,917
Yes, I can.

1191
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,114
We were so close!

1192
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,993
So close. We tripped
at the finish line. Why?

1193
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,318
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1194
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,428
- Where's Meg?
- Oh. Look who's here.

1195
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,917
- Wonderboy, you are too much.
- Let her go.

1196
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,715
Get a grip. Come here. Come here.
Let me show you around.

1197
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,836
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld, after all, huh?

1198
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,629
- Meg!
- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1199
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,354
You see, Meg's running
with a new crowd these days...

1200
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,550
and not a very lively one at that.

1201
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,117
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1202
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:43,394
Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

1203
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,795
- Going once!
- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?

1204
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,798
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1205
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,230
You get her out.
She goes; you stay.

1206
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,476
Oh, you know what slipped my mind?
You'll be dead before
you can get to her.

1207
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,558
That's not a problem, is it?

1208
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,516
Oh!

1209
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,756
What's the matter
with these scissors?

1210
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,269
The thread won't cut.

1211
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,114
This is--
This is impossible!

1212
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,993
You-- You-- You can't be alive.
You'd have to be a, a--

1213
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,680
A god?

1214
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,589
Hercules, stop!
Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't--

1215
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,792
Fine. Okay. Listen.
Okay, well, I deserved that.

1216
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,629
Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?
Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?

1217
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,796
So maybe you could
put in a word with him...

1218
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,956
and he'd kind of blow
this whole thing off, you know?

1219
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,072
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
You know, a little schmooze, uh--

1220
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,914
Get away from me! Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!

1221
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,349
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1222
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,438
- You mean, if he gets outta there.
- Taxi!

1223
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,357
- If? If is good.
- Taxi!

1224
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,995
I don't feel so good.
I-I feel a little--

1225
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,709
Wonderboy, what--
Why did you--

1226
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,909
People always do crazy things
when they're in love.

1227
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,875
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1228
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,714
Three cheers
for the mighty Hercules!

1229
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,673
Oh, yeah.
Flowers for everybody! Oh!

1230
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,391
Hercules!

1231
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,594
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1232
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,154
Mother.

1233
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,277
Fine work, my boy!
You've done it!

1234
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,630
You're a true hero.

1235
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,673
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1236
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,429
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength...

1237
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,155
but by the strength
of his heart.

1238
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,910
Now, at last, my son...

1239
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,759
you can come home.

1240
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,672
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

1241
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,991
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of...

1242
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,476
but...

1243
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,276
a life without Meg,
even an immortal life...

1244
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,153
would be empty.

1245
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,188
I--

1246
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,595
I wish to stay
on Earth with her.

1247
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,314
I finally know where I belong.

1248
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,192
Hit it, ladies.

1249
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,835
Oh, gonna shout it
from the mountaintops

1250
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,439
A star is born

1251
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,835
It's the time
for pullin'out the stops

1252
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,439
A star is born

1253
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,314
- Honey, hit us with a hallelu
- That kid came shinin'through

1254
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,237
Girl, sing the song

1255
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:37,832
Come blow your horn
A star is born, a star is born

1256
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:42,078
- He's a hero who can please the crowd
-A star is born

1257
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,795
Come on, everybody, shout out loud
A star is born

1258
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,833
Just remember in the darkest hour
Within your heart's the power

1259
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:53,589
For makin'you a hero too

1260
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,712
So don't lose hope
when you're forlorn

1261
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,115
- That's Phil's boy!
-Just keep your eyes

1262
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,277
- You just keep your eyes
- Upon the skies
- Upon the skies

1263
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,958
- Every night, a star is
- Every night

1264
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,957
- Right in sight, a star is
- Burning bright

1265
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:11,029
Burning bright
A star is born

1266
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,631
What do ya say?
It's happy ending time!

1267
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,479
Everybody's got a little taste
of somethin' but me. I got nothin'.

1268
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,319
I-I'm here with nothin'.
Anybody listenin'?

1269
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,670
It's like I'm-- What am I,
an echo or something?

1270
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,792
Hello? Hello?
Am I talking to, what?

1271
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,310
Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.
Nobody listens.

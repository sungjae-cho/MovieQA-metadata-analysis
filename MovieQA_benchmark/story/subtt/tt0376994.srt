1
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,730
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,240
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,110
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,270
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,980
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

6
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,490
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,250
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,190
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,260
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,920
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,970
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,440
- Illness?
- John.

13
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,770
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,710
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,210
Of course.

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,880
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,920
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:31,040
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,740
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,150
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,380
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, Charles.

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,200
I like this one.

24
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,850
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,720
The question is, will you
control that power?

26
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,650
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,440
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,080
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

29
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,750
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

30
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,990
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,390
One second!

32
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,630
Open this door.

33
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,460
Warren.

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,340
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

35
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,390
Oh, God.

36
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,850
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,880
The whole world's going to hell and
you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

38
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,160
Bobby!

39
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,070
Thanks, Kitty.

40
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,280
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

41
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,550
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

42
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,060
That was my last cigar.

43
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,890
Logan.

44
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,460
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

45
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,130
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

46
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,000
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

47
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,170
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

48
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,580
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

49
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,090
Class dismissed.

50
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,470
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

51
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,680
Simulation complete.

52
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,310
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

53
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,250
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

54
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,480
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

55
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,680
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

56
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,590
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

57
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,790
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

58
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,240
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

59
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,420
- Scott!
- Jean.

60
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,920
Scott. Scott.

61
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,120
Scott.

62
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,420
Scott.

63
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,600
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

64
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,270
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

65
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,500
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

66
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,010
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

67
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,740
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

68
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,720
- They were looking for you. You
didn't show. - What do you care?

69
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,020
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

70
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,150
No, you didn't. The professor did.

71
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,860
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

72
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,990
Hey, look.

73
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,240
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

74
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,170
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

75
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,150
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

76
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,510
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

77
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,070
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

78
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,220
Mr. President.

79
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,420
Have a seat, Hank.

80
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,920
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

81
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,660
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

82
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,830
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

83
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,600
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

84
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,200
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

85
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,370
Yes, sir. She can do that.

86
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,540
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

87
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,280
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

88
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,620
Where is Magneto?

89
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,330
Raven?

90
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,020
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

91
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,260
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

92
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,860
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

93
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,000
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

94
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,010
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

95
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,810
In here with us.

96
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,950
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

97
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,580
You don't want to play games with me?

98
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,260
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

99
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,600
You wanna know where he is?

100
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,610
Homo sapien.

101
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,280
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

102
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,380
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

103
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,390
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

104
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,900
- I thought that's why you
appointed me, sir. - Yes, it is.

105
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,590
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

106
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,470
It's what she stole from the FDA.

107
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,540
Dear Lord.

108
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,950
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

109
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,660
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

110
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:14,700
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

111
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,200
When an individual acquires great power,

112
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,170
the use or misuse of that
power is everything.

113
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:31,940
Will it be for the greater good or will it be
used for personal or for destructive ends?

114
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,810
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

115
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,580
Why? Because we are mutants.

116
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

117
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,120
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

118
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,890
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

119
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,900
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

120
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,370
without any superhuman authority behind it.

121
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,100
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

122
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,240
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

123
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,250
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

124
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,120
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

125
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,020
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

126
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,250
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

127
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,860
into the body of this man?

128
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,840
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

129
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,380
Professor?

130
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,520
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

131
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,230
The forecast was for sunny skies.

132
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,900
I'm sorry.

133
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,750
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

134
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,820
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

135
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,950
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

136
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,930
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

137
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,130
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

138
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,330
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

139
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,930
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

140
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,320
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

141
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,010
He took Jean's death so hard.

142
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,280
Yes, things are better out there,

143
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,420
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

144
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,090
There's something you're not telling us.

145
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,970
Hank?

146
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,100
Ororo. Charles.

147
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,700
I love what you've done with your hair.

148
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,650
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

149
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,420
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

150
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,720
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

151
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,920
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

152
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,620
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

153
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,200
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

154
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,070
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

155
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,870
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

156
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,340
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

157
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,470
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

158
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,410
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

159
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,010
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

160
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,020
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

161
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,220
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

162
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,130
They're calling it a cure.

163
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,270
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

164
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,600
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

165
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,870
Storm.

166
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,440
They're announcing it now.

167
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,810
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

168
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,010
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

169
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,160
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

170
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,660
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

171
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,990
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

172
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,060
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

173
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,300
Ladies and gentlemen...

174
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,640
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

175
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,180
Finally, we have a cure.

176
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,450
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take itjust to fit in?

177
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,960
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

178
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,120
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

179
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,130
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

180
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,670
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

181
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,600
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant
rights since before you had claws.

182
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,910
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

183
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,310
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

184
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,980
No. Professor.

185
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,150
They can't cure us.

186
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,320
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

187
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,920
Or any of us, for that matter.

188
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,830
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

189
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,070
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

190
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,670
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

191
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,910
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

192
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,960
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

193
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,930
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

194
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,630
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

195
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,230
Nobody is talking about extermination.

196
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,100
No one ever talks about it.

197
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,130
They just do it.

198
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,410
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

199
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:48,250
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

200
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,220
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

201
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,520
the extermination has already begun.

202
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,230
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

203
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,300
They will force their cure upon us.

204
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,040
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

205
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,410
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

206
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,640
Who will you stand with? The humans?

207
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,280
Or us?

208
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,360
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

209
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,660
Back off.

210
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,000
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

211
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,640
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

212
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,680
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

213
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,610
You know who you're talking to?

214
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,770
Do you?

215
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,550
And what can you do?

216
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,890
So you have talents?

217
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,090
That and more. I know you control metal.

218
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,260
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

219
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,390
Other than you two.

220
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,370
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

221
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,270
Could you locate one for me?

222
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,360
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

223
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,100
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

224
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh, Mr. President.

225
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,170
Shut up.

226
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:56,070
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

227
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,840
Please.

228
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,750
Keep it up. I'll spray you
in the face, bitch.

229
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,720
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

230
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,890
Yeah, right.

231
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,360
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

232
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,790
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

233
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,670
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

234
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,170
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

235
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,840
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

236
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,850
Until we can fully map his DNA. We can
replicate it, but we can't generate it.

237
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,380
And his power? What is its range?

238
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,510
You'll see.

239
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,190
Jimmy.

240
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,850
There's someone I would like you to meet.

241
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,990
Hello there, son.

242
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,000
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

243
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,210
I'm sorry.

244
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,240
It's OK.

245
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,050
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

246
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,130
Extraordinary, isn't he?

247
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,370
Yes, he is.

248
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,280
Scott.

249
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,890
Scott.

250
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,350
Scott.

251
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,560
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

252
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,170
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

253
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,960
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

254
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,500
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

255
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,440
Stop!

256
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,290
Jean?

257
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,430
Scott.

258
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,940
How?

259
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,970
I don't know.

260
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,760
I wanna see your eyes.

261
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,990
- Take these off.
- No.

262
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,010
No.

263
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,770
Trust me. I can control it now.

264
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,650
Open them. You can't hurt me.

265
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,360
- What happened?
- No clue.

266
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,160
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

267
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,960
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

268
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,380
I can't see a damn thing.

269
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,820
I can take care of that.

270
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,200
What the...

271
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,600
Logan!

272
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,350
She's alive.

273
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,950
Jean.

274
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,700
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

275
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,030
The only explanation of Jean's survival

276
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,900
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

277
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,730
Is she gonna be OK?

278
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,540
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've
ever encountered, her potential limitless.

279
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:20,380
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

280
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,980
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

281
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,650
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

282
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,790
- Jean developed a dual
personality. - What?

283
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,860
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

284
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,040
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

285
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:52,450
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

286
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,850
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

287
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,190
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

288
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,730
or the Phoenix furiously
struggling to be free.

289
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,770
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

290
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,400
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

291
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,840
What have you done to her?

292
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,470
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

293
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,610
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

294
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,190
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

295
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,490
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

296
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,530
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

297
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,430
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

298
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,400
It sounds to me like Jean
had no choice at all.

299
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,870
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

300
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,580
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

301
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,020
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

302
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,460
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

303
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,790
Some are desperate for this cure while
others are offended by the very idea of it.

304
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,140
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

305
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,480
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

306
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,560
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

307
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,250
Good. Bring him in.

308
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,550
Are you sure you want to start with him?

309
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,130
I think it's important. Yes.

310
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,060
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

311
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,670
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

312
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,570
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

313
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,200
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

314
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,810
You ready?

315
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,040
The transformation can be a little jarring.

316
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,780
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

317
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,860
It'll all be over soon.

318
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,820
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

319
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,860
Warren, calm down.

320
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,030
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

321
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,260
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

322
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,170
- I promise you it will be fine.
Warren, relax. - Dad.

323
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,340
Warren, it's a better life.

324
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,010
- It's what we all want.
- No.

325
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,520
It's what you want.

326
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,090
Warren, no!

327
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Told you so.

328
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,920
About time.

329
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,550
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

330
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,430
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

331
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,290
Without him, they have nothing.

332
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,430
Read off the guest list.

333
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,830
"Cell 41205. James Madrox. "

334
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,030
This one robbed seven banks.

335
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,080
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

336
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,850
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

337
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,530
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement. "

338
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,590
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times. "

339
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,140
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him. "

340
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,830
How fascinating.

341
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,210
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

342
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,440
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

343
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,460
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

344
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,700
I think he'll make a fine
addition to our army.

345
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,810
No!

346
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,200
You saved me.

347
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,800
Eric.

348
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,870
I'm sorry, my dear.

349
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,610
You're not one of us any more.

350
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,280
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

351
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,300
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

352
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,030
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

353
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,260
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

354
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,140
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

355
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,440
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

356
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,850
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

357
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,110
I have.

358
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,780
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

359
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,920
As do I.

360
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,890
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

361
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,230
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

362
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,760
Jean.

363
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,010
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

364
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,920
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

365
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,710
Are you OK?

366
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,510
Yeah.

367
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,790
More than OK.

368
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,640
Logan, you're making me blush.

369
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,240
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

370
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,820
It's OK.

371
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,230
It's OK.

372
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,540
- Wait.
- No.

373
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,640
Jean.

374
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,810
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

375
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,890
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

376
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,160
The professor said you might be different.

377
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,430
He would know, wouldn't he?

378
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,300
What? You think he's not in your head too?

379
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,970
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

380
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,410
Where's Scott?

381
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,850
Jean?

382
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,220
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

383
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,860
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

384
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,330
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

385
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,940
Oh, God.

386
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,180
Look at me.

387
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,100
Stay with me. Talk to me.

388
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,030
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

389
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,000
Focus. Focus, Jean.

390
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,540
Kill me.

391
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,410
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

392
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,100
- Don't say that.
- Please.

393
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,810
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

394
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,220
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

395
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,080
It'll be all right. We can help you.

396
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,620
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

397
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,700
I don't want to fix it.

398
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:30,670
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

399
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,340
I told you they would draw first blood.

400
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,010
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

401
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:43,080
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

402
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,250
Come. We have an army to build.

403
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,620
I picked something up.

404
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,890
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

405
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,500
It's a mutant.

406
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,700
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

407
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,170
More powerful than you.

408
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,080
Where is she?

409
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,180
Logan.

410
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,380
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

411
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,550
What have you done?

412
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,960
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

413
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:31,060
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

414
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,840
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

415
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,980
It may be too late.

416
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,550
- Wait for me here.
- What?

417
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,680
I need to see Jean alone.

418
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,620
You were right, Charles.

419
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,130
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

420
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,230
Same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.

421
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,570
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

422
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,700
So, shall we go inside?

423
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,540
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

424
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,780
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

425
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,680
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

426
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,810
Nobody gets inside.

427
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,170
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

428
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,110
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

429
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:22,740
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

430
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,780
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

431
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,720
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

432
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,920
No. I want to help you.

433
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,220
Help me? What's wrong with me?

434
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,230
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

435
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,360
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

436
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,990
For your own good, Jean.

437
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,000
Stay out of my head.

438
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:53,810
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

439
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,010
Look at me, Jean. I can
help you. Look at me.

440
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,150
Get out of my head.

441
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,700
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

442
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,170
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

443
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:20,470
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

444
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,970
No! Stop it!

445
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,710
That's it.

446
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,180
Jean, let me in.

447
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,480
No, Jean.

448
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,610
Jean!

449
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,880
Don't let it control you.

450
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,660
Charles.

451
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,260
My dear. Come with me.

452
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,930
No.

453
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,810
God!

454
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,880
We live in an age of darkness.

455
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:04,720
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

456
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,890
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

457
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,730
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

458
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:17,740
A world he tried to heal.

459
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,640
A mission he never saw accomplished.

460
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:27,410
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

461
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:32,850
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

462
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,520
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

463
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:40,530
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

464
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:48,730
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

465
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,330
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

466
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,340
And that's a vision of a world united.

467
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,400
Kitty.

468
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,490
Bobby.

469
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,470
- You OK?
- Yeah.

470
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,640
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

471
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:42,920
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

472
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,050
Yeah, me too.

473
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:49,360
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

474
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,660
You have Rogue and I have...

475
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,700
You know, I just miss home.

476
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,670
The first snow and all that.

477
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,510
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

478
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,100
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

479
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,840
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

480
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,710
Come on.

481
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,860
This place can be home too.

482
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,160
Thank you for this, Bobby.

483
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,580
You need a lift, kid?

484
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:29,750
No.

485
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,820
Where are you going?

486
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,060
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

487
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,570
Yeah, I do.

488
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,330
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

489
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,930
A hug. A handshake.

490
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,980
A kiss.

491
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:56,610
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

492
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,820
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

493
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,350
Just be sure it's what you want.

494
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,560
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

495
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,720
To go upstairs and unpack?

496
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,030
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

497
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,240
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

498
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,900
Marie.

499
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,300
Marie.

500
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:08,590
Remember when we first met? Do you
know what I saw when I looked at you?

501
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,720
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

502
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:22,660
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

503
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:30,980
I can manipulate the metal in this,

504
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,570
but you, you can do anything.

505
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,950
Anything you can think of.

506
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,690
Jean.

507
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,820
Enough.

508
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,330
Enough.

509
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,900
You sound just like him.

510
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,940
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

511
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,140
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

512
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,210
As nature intended.

513
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:18,150
That cure is meant for all of us. If we
want freedom, we must fight for it.

514
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,720
And that fight begins now.

515
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,100
She shouldn't be here with us.

516
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,970
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

517
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,550
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

518
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:46,520
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

519
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:50,710
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

520
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:56,630
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

521
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,480
So what now? What do we do?

522
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,140
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

523
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:25,160
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

524
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:31,090
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

525
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,760
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

526
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:43,210
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

527
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,370
It was, son.

528
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,250
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

529
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:57,290
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

530
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,400
Rogue.

531
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,400
Hey, Rogue.

532
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:29,890
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

533
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,470
Logan.

534
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,130
Logan.

535
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,040
- Logan.
- Jean?

536
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,940
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

537
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,980
Logan. Logan.

538
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,410
- Logan.
- Stop.

539
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,850
Logan. Logan. Logan.

540
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,400
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

541
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:26,380
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

542
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,910
She killed the professor.

543
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,350
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

544
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,650
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

545
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,490
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

546
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,650
Because you love her.

547
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,240
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

548
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,540
So if you're with us, then be with us.

549
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,830
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

550
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,490
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

551
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,430
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

552
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,500
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

553
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:32,240
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

554
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,040
I'm looking for someone.

555
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,280
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

556
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:44,680
I figured she'd want the
cure. She's pathetic.

557
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,890
Come on, Iceman.

558
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:54,660
Make a move.

559
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,740
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

560
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,250
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

561
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,260
So long as the cure exists,
our war will rage.

562
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:29,770
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

563
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:33,770
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

564
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,670
Join us or stay out of our way.

565
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,740
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

566
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:46,710
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

567
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,710
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

568
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:55,950
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

569
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:59,730
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

570
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:06,030
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

571
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,370
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

572
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,100
Let's go. Keep it moving.

573
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:15,870
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

574
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,510
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

575
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,750
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

576
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,950
Absolutely no metal.

577
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:40,470
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

578
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:45,340
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

579
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,780
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

580
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:15,290
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

581
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:23,530
The cure for that infirm, imperfect
condition called homo sapiens.

582
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,700
They have their weapons.

583
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:30,770
We have ours.

584
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:39,240
We will strike with a vengeance and a
fury that this world has never witnessed.

585
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:46,950
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

586
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,320
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

587
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,620
take control of the cure,

588
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:55,130
and destroy its source.

589
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:58,930
And then nothing can stop us.

590
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,920
Jean.

591
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,660
I know the smell of your adamantium
from a mile away.

592
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:34,670
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

593
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:40,340
- I came for Jean. - You think
I'm keeping her against her will?

594
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,960
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

595
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,690
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

596
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,300
And you stood there and let him die?

597
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:04,030
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

598
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,510
OK.

599
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:24,250
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

600
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:30,350
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

601
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:36,960
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

602
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:41,400
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

603
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,140
Approaching target dead ahead.

604
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,740
Set for 360-degree incursion.

605
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,860
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

606
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,530
OK, send them in.

607
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,830
OK.

608
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:51,380
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

609
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,550
OK. I give up.

610
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,830
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

611
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,930
If he's not there, then
where the hell is he?

612
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:27,310
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

613
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:30,780
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

614
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,610
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

615
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,310
Leave that to me.

616
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:45,560
Storm. Storm.

617
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,430
What are you doing back here?

618
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,560
I need help.

619
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:53,470
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

620
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:56,440
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

621
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:01,840
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

622
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:05,410
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

623
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,580
Let's suit up.

624
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,890
- Hard to believe this once fit me. - If
Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

625
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,960
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

626
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:24,760
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

627
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,810
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

628
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,470
I'm not gonna lie to you.

629
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,940
But we lost Scott.

630
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,170
We lost the professor.

631
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:41,280
If we don't fight now, everything
they stood for will die with them.

632
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,150
I'm not gonna let that happen.

633
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,320
Are you?

634
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,520
Then we stand together.

635
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:53,230
X- Men.

636
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:55,360
All of us.

637
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:04,270
We're in.

638
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:06,470
Let's go.

639
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,450
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

640
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:19,750
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

641
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,310
Dad, what's going on?

642
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,670
It's an earthquake.

643
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,720
We're trapped.

644
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,850
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

645
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,230
My God.

646
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:51,260
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

647
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:10,670
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

648
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:14,120
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

649
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,800
In chess, the pawns go first.

650
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,000
Humans and their guns.

651
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,790
Plastic. They've learned.

652
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,760
That's why the pawns go first.

653
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,000
Target the bridge.

654
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,420
Fire!

655
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:31,960
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

656
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:56,020
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

657
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:02,420
- What aboutjets? Tanks? - Against
Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

658
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,330
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

659
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:09,220
Then God help us.

660
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,100
They're coming for him.

661
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:58,180
Don't ever do that again.

662
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,120
You men cover the doors!

663
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:09,490
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

664
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,010
Traitors to their own cause.

665
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:36,780
Finish them!

666
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,720
Not yet.

667
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:31,200
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

668
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:33,370
With pleasure.

669
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,850
Hold it!

670
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,780
He's going for the boy!

671
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:48,120
Not if I get there first.

672
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,320
Kitty!

673
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,700
Come on.

674
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,780
Grow those back.

675
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,480
Don't you know who I am?

676
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:24,090
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

677
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,020
Going somewhere?

678
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,190
You're the guy that
invented the cure, right?

679
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,330
Yes, I am.

680
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:08,900
Girls.

681
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,340
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

682
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,670
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

683
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:17,010
Calm down. Calm down.

684
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,380
Everything's gonna be OK.

685
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:43,360
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time... "

686
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:46,070
Oh, you get the point.

687
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:49,310
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

688
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,640
No.

689
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:01,590
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

690
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,290
This way.

691
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:10,360
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

692
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:16,400
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

693
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,070
I'm the wrong guy to
play hide-and-seek with.

694
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:24,710
Who's hiding, dickhead?

695
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,060
Don't. No.

696
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:40,690
Don't.

697
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,700
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

698
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,740
Do we look like we need your help?

699
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:19,930
It's time to end this war.

700
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,680
Take cover.

701
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,020
Get out of the way.

702
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:51,900
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

703
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,600
Go! Go! Go!

704
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:45,160
We work as a team.

705
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,250
Best defense is a good offence.

706
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,930
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

707
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,310
Go ahead.

708
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,080
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

709
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:18,250
Right.

710
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,900
You're in over your head, Bobby.

711
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,980
Maybe you should go back to school.

712
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:26,120
You never should have left.

713
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:29,490
This is it.

714
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:31,600
Hey.

715
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:34,660
Make it a strike.

716
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:47,870
You never learn, do you?

717
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,940
Actually, I do.

718
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,660
I'm...

719
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:11,430
One of them?

720
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:24,850
This is what they want for all of us.

721
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:47,770
It's over, Jean.

722
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,300
It's over.

723
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,500
No! Don't shoot!

724
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,330
No!

725
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:32,510
Everybody get out of there!

726
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:43,080
Bobby!

727
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,260
What have I done?

728
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:10,380
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

729
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,990
Go.

730
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,290
Jean!

731
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:05,570
Jean!

732
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:08,110
I know you're still there!

733
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,290
You would die for them?

734
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,460
No, not for them.

735
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:03,690
For you.

736
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,690
For you.

737
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:14,770
Save me.

738
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,310
I love you.

739
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,280
You're back.

740
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:09,120
I'm sorry.

741
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,250
I had to.

742
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:15,160
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

743
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:18,700
It's what I want.

744
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,610
Hey.

745
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:35,820
Good to see you, buddy.

746
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:38,620
With the thanks of a grateful nation

747
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:41,880
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

748
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:46,220
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

749
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:49,160
human and mutant alike,

750
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:51,330
Dr. Hank McCoy.

751
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:56,770
Way to go, fur ball.

752
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,370
Morning.

753
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,510
Hello, Moira.

754
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,590
Charles.

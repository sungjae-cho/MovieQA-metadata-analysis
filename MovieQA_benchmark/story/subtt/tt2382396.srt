1
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,178
Hey, old man, you look at me.

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,148
I got something to say to you.

3
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,050
Every time we land someplace new,

4
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,986
you say it's gonna be
different, but it ain't.

5
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,929
You mess up a lot,
then you leave a mess

6
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,598
for me and Mama and
Dorothy to clean up

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,768
and that ain't right.
That's all I'm saying.

8
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,237
Hell, I do what I gotta do.

9
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,774
You do whatever the hell you want,
whatever you can get away with.

10
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,948
You're just a selfish old drunk.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,218
Yeah, that's what you is.

12
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,090
This place is gonna be after us.

13
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,092
Hell, they'll be on you,

14
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,828
and they're gonna beat your ass.

15
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,600
And I hate to see you go down.

16
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,835
I know you're my daddy.

17
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,540
You know you sure are, ain't you?

18
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,775
I'm talking at you.

19
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,053
What you done this time,

20
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,889
they'll beat your ass to shit.

21
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,625
That's what they're gonna do.

22
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,795
You can count on it.

23
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,737
<i>Service but was looking at some
of the Doppler radar estimates</i>

24
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:43,455
<i>and it looked as if close to
three inches of rain fell</i>

25
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,157
<i>with a little
thunderstorm complex...</i>

26
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,642
Round 'em up, Junior.

27
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:07,045
- <i>Yo, it ain't lunchtime yet.
- Round 'em up.</i>

28
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,880
<i>Let's pack up the gear, guys.</i>

29
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,115
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

30
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:25,897
One at a time, one at a time.

31
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,066
- Hey, hey, hey... one at a time.
- <i>I'm trying to get situated.</i>

32
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:32,437
Go, go, go.

33
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,443
Why y'all moving so slow? Looks like
y'all goddamn turtles out there.

34
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,278
It's getting rained on!

35
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,259
<i>Damn, Joe, when you gonna
get that new truck, Joe?</i>

36
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:57,762
What's wrong with this one?

37
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,898
It's raggedy. You can't
tell what's wrong with it?

38
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,233
- You don't know?
- Yeah...

39
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,036
- think I'd get another one.
- Damn right.

40
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,839
Let me get a cigarette.

41
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,914
I'm gonna have to start
taking this out of your pay.

42
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,254
All right, then.

43
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,156
See you tomorrow
if the sun comes up.

44
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,025
<i>I'll holler at you in the morning.
Let me know.</i>

45
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,993
All right.

46
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,397
Which jersey now?
Pittsburgh yellow?

47
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,844
<i>All right!</i>

48
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,555
You can see the moisture
moving northward

49
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,158
out of Mexico and also
out into the Gulf of Mexico,

50
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,893
meeting up
with this frontal system,

51
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,962
which is slowly being...
been sagging southward.

52
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,532
As we look at temperatures
with the cloud cover,

53
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,433
<i>not as hot as what
we've been seeing,</i>

54
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,170
<i>but the cool-down isn't
related to Canadian air.</i>

55
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,139
<i>Here's some Canadian air over the
northeastern part of the country.</i>

56
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,275
<i>Very high dew points.</i>

57
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,844
<i>This represents a whole lot
of moisture available to us</i>

58
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,880
<i>and to those tall clouds
producing the heavy rains.</i>

59
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,183
<i>So the showers and thunderstorms
during tonight...</i>

60
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,088
- Morning, Junior.
- <i>Morning, Joe.</i>

61
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,528
You going to work this morning?

62
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:41,125
<i>Shit, Joe. If it's gonna rain,
call me. I'll show up.</i>

63
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,027
What about Shorty?
He get drunk last night?

64
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,597
- <i>Shorty almost got arrested last night.</i>
- What? He what?

65
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,266
<i>- Hell, yeah.</i>

66
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:53,338
All right. Yeah, I'll be up
at Coleman's in 30 minutes.

67
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,208
- Y'all be ready.
- <i>Bye-bye!</i>

68
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,576
Ooh, Shorty, that was
a rough night last night.

69
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,645
Almost didn't make it
to work this morning, boy.

70
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,548
- I heard some stories.
- You'd be surprised.

71
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,150
Drinking and trying to touch
this lady on the butt.

72
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,395
<i>Here's Joe, y'all.
Here's Joe.</i>

73
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,198
Come on, Joe,
help a brother out, now.

74
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,965
- Good morning, Joe.
- Morning.

75
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,067
Y'all come go with me.

76
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,335
- All right.
- Don't know why, either.

77
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,204
Don't make no sense,
though, you know?

78
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,340
- Morning, John.
- <i>Hello, Joe.</i>

79
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,542
- <i>You want some coffee?</i>
<i>- No, I can get it.</i>

80
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:35,446
It ain't cold, is it?
It was cold yesterday.

81
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,018
<i>Now let's see, you're Bill, right?</i>

82
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,352
I'm Shorty, he's Bill.

83
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,655
- Where's Sammy today?
- Sammy gone fishing, Joe.

84
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,924
Hell, Sammy told me you fired him.

85
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,592
I fired his ass three
times already.

86
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,527
You tell Sammy I'm gonna
fire him for good

87
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,129
if he don't start
helping me out some.

88
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,598
- Y'all want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure, man.

89
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,467
- See that ball game last night?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

90
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,703
Them boys played
one hell of a game.

91
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,010
<i>- Who won, though?</i>
- We did, of course.

92
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,608
- Shorty, you want some of these wieners?
- I'm good.

93
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,110
Shorty, if you had one like this,
you'd be a bad boy, God damn.

94
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,713
Uh-huh, whatever. You got
one of these right here.

95
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,549
<i>That's a shriveled Slim Jim.</i>

96
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,051
<i>Act like you ain't got
nothing to do today.</i>

97
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,686
Y'all gonna quit pussyfooting
around me today.

98
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,422
You gonna get some work
out of me, Junior.

99
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,357
All right, you're gonna take
the east side over here.

100
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,625
Take the east side over there.

101
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,168
<i>- You all right?
- Yes, sir.</i>

102
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,063
<i>I want you to take the west side
over here today, all right?</i>

103
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,333
Why you looking at me like you retarded?
Get that thing on and go with him.

104
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,969
- <i>Shorty, you all right today?
- Yeah, I'm good, man.</i>

105
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,404
Feeling pretty good? You look
like a goddamn Ghostbuster today.

106
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,074
You all right? You gonna
fight like one today?

107
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,576
- You gonna work like one?
- I work well, my man.

108
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,178
- Huh?
- I'm good.

109
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,347
- All right, don't trip on it.
- Yeah.

110
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,083
Huh? Yeah, you're gonna go bust
a move on me today, Shorty.

111
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,518
Yeah, bust them trees.

112
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,487
<i>A snake!</i>

113
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,189
Better watch it there, man.

114
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,592
I don't know. That
cottonmouth's pretty big.

115
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,161
Look here.

116
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,464
Look at that. Don't
know how big he is.

117
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,399
- Watch it there!
- Watch it, watch it!

118
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,469
- Watch it!
- Ooh!

119
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,905
Hey, Junior.

120
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,574
Whoo-hoo, that's a big one now!

121
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,477
He can be known as the snake god.

122
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,353
Joe, you got nuts of a bear, Joe.

123
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,854
That's what that woman
told me last night...

124
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,924
"I need another snake."
I've seen one today.

125
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,727
<i>Yeah.</i>

126
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,466
That's what that fat woman said.

127
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,538
<i>We got company.</i>

128
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:58,809
Let me see that snake.

129
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,781
- Ain't he a nice one?
- Mm.

130
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,317
See those fangs?

131
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,853
You get bit by those,
you're gonna die.

132
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,322
You're gonna wanna die.

133
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,725
Y'all don't kill it.
It's my friend.

134
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,360
- Whoa!
- Damn!

135
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,962
<i>Almost throwed it over by me!</i>

136
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,265
Get back to work, y'all.
The show is over with.

137
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,801
- I heard you screaming.
- I wasn't scared. I just move fast.

138
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,304
<i>Whatever.</i>

139
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,206
What y'all doing?
Y'all cutting these trees?

140
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,909
We're killing trees.

141
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,711
What for?

142
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,647
Nedermeyer land.

143
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,784
The owner hires us to
get rid of what's on it

144
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:44,222
so they can come in
and put strong pines on it.

145
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,791
<i>Nobody wants these trees.</i>
<i>These trees are weak.</i>

146
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:50,561
<i>They're not good for anything.</i>

147
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,697
These boys will sit down if
I don't stay on their asses.

148
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,599
- Hey, mister.
- Yeah?

149
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,567
<i>I got a question for you.</i>

150
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,835
You see, me and my daddy
just got into town.

151
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,471
I was wondering if
you'd give us a job.

152
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:04,609
We're looking for work.

153
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:09,447
- How old are you?
- 15.

154
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,817
Well, you got 45 seconds to
tell me why I should hire you.

155
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,685
I baled hay before,
I worked on a truck.

156
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,790
I picked tomatoes,
zucchini, cucumbers.

157
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,792
Uh, okra. Squash.

158
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,929
All right. You're not
afraid of work. Good.

159
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,465
- What's your name?
- Gary Jones.

160
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,933
I'm Joe.

161
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,002
I pay a day's pay for a day's work.

162
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,304
I pay on Fridays, so you get
a little something today.

163
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,407
- Okay.
- <i>But your first real payday is next Friday.</i>

164
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,843
We start about 6:00 in the morning,

165
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,545
<i>quit at 1:00 or 2:00.</i>

166
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,948
And if we work till dinner or get
rained out, I pay for the whole day.

167
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,950
- Does that sound fair enough?
- Yes, sir.

168
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,685
<i>All right. Follow
this line of trees...</i>

169
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,021
- Yes, sir.
- Close to a half mile back to my truck.

170
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,989
- Juice hatchets are in the back.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

171
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,458
You get yourself one,
fill it up with poison,

172
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,427
come on back same way you went out.

173
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,962
- Yes, sir.
- And don't get lost.

174
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,031
- I won't.
- Hey!

175
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,835
Don't you want to know how
much you're getting paid?

176
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,604
- How you doing?
- Good.

177
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,938
Doing all right?
You ready to work today?

178
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,674
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Junior.

179
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,076
- Gary.
- Well, Gary, I'm gonna be over you today.

180
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,645
Raise your right hand. You're gonna have
to swear you're gonna work hard for me.

181
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,781
Not that hand, your right hand.
Your other right.

182
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,383
Your right hand. There you go.

183
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,419
<i>Put your hand up. You got
to swear on something.</i>

184
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,422
Now you on the all-star team.

185
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,524
- You promise to work hard?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,960
I don't know why Joe chose you.
You must be a good man.

187
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,096
First thing we do
is fill these containers up,

188
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,831
so we just gonna
put it in there like that.

189
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,767
Once we get it filled up
real good, then we on.

190
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,869
- What's in the poison?
- Shit.

191
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,339
Shorty's grandmas
make this in they basement.

192
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,074
I don't know what's in it, but
we ain't gonna worry about it.

193
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,975
I know it works real good.

194
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,877
You thought that was easy
pumping that thing, didn't you?

195
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,080
I made it look easy
'cause I'm a man.

196
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,516
You're a little boy... you got to figure
it out. You see what I'm saying?

197
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,819
There you go. See how
you figured that out?

198
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,788
When you become a man, you gonna
have everything figured out too.

199
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,758
Be careful. Now this
stuff is real poisonous

200
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,427
and if it gets in your eyes,
man, you're out of there.

201
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,732
Just ask Junior.
Now... now here you go.

202
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,568
- Which hand you use?
- Uh, the right.

203
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,450
Okay.

204
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:14,972
Prime it up a little
bit, keep striking it.

205
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,075
If you hit it hard enough, you only
have to hit it three or four times.

206
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,714
Gotta get angry at the tree,
man. Get mad at it.

207
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,784
Yeah, I like that. Get mad at it.
Keep on working it.

208
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,520
Mad. Work with it, work with it!

209
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,690
Yes, sir. Get it!

210
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,924
Keep on with it, youngster.

211
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,960
I like that, man.

212
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,462
Joe's been around, he's been
around a little bit, man.

213
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,599
He's got some things
up under his belt, man.

214
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,168
So I advise you,
when you do go to Joe,

215
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,505
keep it real with Joe. Don't
lie to him about nothing.

216
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,174
And one thing Joe is real
particular about, man...

217
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,177
don't never look down at the
ground. Look him in the face.

218
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,680
He likes to see a man's eyes.
You... one-on-one.

219
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,717
- That's how Joe is, man.
- Where you from?

220
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,520
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?

221
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,722
Being a little bitty boy,
you been everywhere, huh?

222
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,891
Was your daddy in the
military or something?

223
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:11,662
Oh, yeah? All right. You got
a family? All right, then.

224
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,898
You know we ain't gonna cut you
no slack out here, don't you?

225
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,566
Just 'cause you're young now,

226
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,934
you know we ain't
gonna cut no slack.

227
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,569
<i>Everybody pull their
own load, baby.</i>

228
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,538
Once we get this filled up here,

229
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,707
we can kill us about a hundred
trees with this here.

230
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,876
Is killing trees against the law?

231
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,079
Well, the lumber company

232
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,848
can't cut 'em down
unless they dead,

233
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,917
and so the lumber company hire us

234
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,519
to come in and poison the trees

235
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,122
so we can kill 'em and they'll
come in and die theyself.

236
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,057
Yeah, I've been doing this
for a little minute now.

237
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,159
- Welcome to the program.
- Thanks.

238
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,313
It's hard work out here.

239
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:46,530
The machete crew is the one that
comes through and clears it out.

240
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,798
Chop down at the angles.

241
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,567
Try to get as low as you can.

242
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,603
You gotta clear the path
for your teammates.

243
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:56,507
Without you, none of
this is gonna happen.

244
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,176
Just keep hammering at it.
Nothing's stopping you.

245
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,678
You have to start out...
you'll probably be

246
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,546
the water man for
a little while, you know?

247
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,181
It's gonna look like you're
doing everything for everybody,

248
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,985
bringing 'em water. At the end,
you'll become a machete vet.

249
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,720
Samurai king, right here.

250
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,056
- Waa-ah!
- Waa-ah!

251
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,958
Welcome to the crew.
You're the youngest.

252
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,559
<i>Gotta crawl 'fore you walk.</i>

253
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,862
Got a lot of energy there.

254
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,831
- Hah!
- There you go.

255
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:25,936
- Samurai gods!
- Yah!

256
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,005
Crew! When y'all get through
this side over here,

257
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,273
we're going to the west side.

258
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,008
<i>All right.</i>

259
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,878
Hey, Gary, you're
getting too far ahead.

260
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,614
Come on back here.
Help these fellas out.

261
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:55,599
You know what? You, you and you,
y'all did a good job today.

262
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,167
Why don't y'all
go ahead and get paid,

263
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,870
and I'll see y'all
Monday, all right?

264
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:00,971
Bill.

265
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,007
- Allan.
- Thank you, sir.

266
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,678
- And Gary, right?
- Yes, sir.

267
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,548
Gary, Gary, Gary.

268
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,285
Come back Monday.

269
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,887
Bring your daddy
if he wants to work.

270
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,857
Yes, sir, I will.

271
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,126
We'll be there. Thanks.

272
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,861
Mama!

273
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,831
Hey, Mama, guess what?

274
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,868
I got us jobs today.

275
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,973
- I got a job today.
- Good for you, baby.

276
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:19,216
<i>Dorothy!</i>
<i>Dorothy, guess what.</i>

277
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,319
<i>He got one. That's good.</i>

278
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:38,102
Stop! Sorry.

279
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,316
Got that asshole put away?

280
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,285
Yes, Joe, he's in the back.

281
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,355
That asshole bites me again...

282
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,190
Well, he's got the devil in him.

283
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:04,194
- Fuck that.
- Come on, baby.

284
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:13,037
Well, look at that. What's that?

285
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,408
Come here.

286
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,045
A Mexican game show.
That's what I'm talking about.

287
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:25,349
<i>- Can I fix you something, baby?
- Coke, ice.</i>

288
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,228
Here you go, sweetie.

289
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,971
So what you got
the blues over, Joe?

290
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,308
I'm not so bad.

291
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,179
Want one of my girls?

292
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,414
You want two of my girls?

293
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:02,486
Not today. Today is a special day.

294
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:07,324
- It is?
- I only want your company, Merle.

295
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,233
- Why, thank you.
- Come here.

296
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:19,236
Mmm!

297
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:24,174
Lace!

298
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,176
- Asshole!
- Lacy!

299
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,912
Put the dog in the back!

300
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,915
I got it. Come on. I got it.

301
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,984
Come on.

302
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,456
You don't need that thing
to take care of you.

303
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,861
Where are you going, Joe?

304
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,870
Girl, get your ass off the floor.

305
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,774
Quit being stupid.

306
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,463
- You see who that was?
- Yes.

307
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,032
Was that World War I or II?
Where'd you get that hat?

308
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,034
- W-W-2.
- Oh, right.

309
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,969
Got it down there at the Army-Navy.

310
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,939
Been making some money over at
Henry's house, throwing the dice.

311
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,908
Yeah, I know. I was gonna go
over there later, clean him out.

312
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,310
Maybe I'll see you there.

313
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,145
I've been doing pretty
good taking the money

314
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,282
from them old ladies that old
blind George hang out with.

315
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,085
<i>Take about 60 or 70% of my winnings</i>

316
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,188
and donate it to
the diabetes research.

317
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,717
- Hmm.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

318
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:49,326
Then I take the rest of it
and buy war paraphernalia.

319
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,329
One of these days
I'm gonna be a regular GI Joe.

320
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,498
Pow. Fistful of dollars!

321
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,267
Or something like that.

322
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,882
Henry.

323
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,951
In here, Joe!

324
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,855
Hey, Joe. How you been doing?

325
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,139
What are you up to today?

326
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,959
- Who's that?
- <i>Henry's just making a damn mess here.</i>

327
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,228
- What are you trying to do, Henry?
- I don't know.

328
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,035
Yeah, well, I don't think
I'd cut it into a roast.

329
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,604
<i>No.</i>

330
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,038
You can do it any way you want to,

331
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,607
but if it was mine,
I'd cut it into steaks.

332
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,942
Come over here and show
him how to do it, honey.

333
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,978
And Henry, you can sit down there

334
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,080
and tell me a joke
or sing a song or something.

335
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,449
Shit, you might as well just
let Blind George cut it up.

336
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:49,553
I'm gonna sit down and have me a
cigarette in this wheelchair.

337
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:53,323
- Couldn't you, George?
- I reckon I could do better than he's doing it.

338
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,925
- Oh, no.
- No.

339
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,661
All right, I'll show you
how to make the steaks.

340
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,497
That'd be good, baby.
I love back scrapple.

341
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,001
That's good. That's enough.

342
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,544
<i>Now look what happened
to the poor thing.</i>

343
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,080
<i>So much blood on the floor.</i>

344
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,516
<i>Oh, God. Oh.</i>

345
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,623
Where'd you get this deer?

346
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,593
It was hung up on
the fence over at Mr. Lee's,

347
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:33,230
<i>and Henry and I was</i>
<i>coming back from the IHOP,</i>

348
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,266
and I took out my .38
and shot her in the head.

349
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,195
No.

350
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:41,405
<i>Honey, you use that knife
just like an artist's brush.</i>

351
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:44,675
<i>I mean, you know what
you're doing, Joe.</i>

352
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:48,512
<i>Man, look at that. Oh, man.</i>

353
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:51,014
- There's some good stuff here.
<i>- That is some good stuff.</i>

354
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,284
Now look here.

355
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,655
<i>Man, that is pretty.</i>

356
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,526
Yeah, that's how you do it.
Butterfly steak.

357
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,628
- <i>Wonderful.</i>
<i>- You see how I did that?</i>

358
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,298
Now do it here, here and here.

359
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,067
Y'all can cut up the rest of it.

360
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,102
So, when you gonna
have another crap game?

361
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,439
Uh, tonight. You wanna come by?

362
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,074
- What time?
- 10:00.

363
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,475
We're making a birthday cake.

364
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,031
<i>We?</i>

365
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,245
Joe, you know who's gonna
make the birthday cake.

366
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,015
<i>I'm</i> gonna make a
birthday cake tonight.

367
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,350
Are you, Stacy?

368
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,485
<i>I love you, Henry,
but you know what?</i>

369
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:30,487
I am the fucking birthday girl here

370
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,522
and I have to make
my own damn cake?

371
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,758
<i>It's not my problem.</i>

372
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,331
<i>I'll make me a birthday
cake, no problem.</i>

373
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,699
I gotta go uptown.
Y'all need anything?

374
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,102
Honey, I think I need
some freezer paper.

375
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,371
Bring me back some
damn freezer paper

376
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:50,140
<i>and another pack of cigarettes.</i>

377
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:53,210
- Good stuff.
- We love you, baby.

378
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,045
<i>That back scrapple, that's the part</i>

379
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,148
<i>that basically I only eat.</i>

380
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,085
Hello, Joe!

381
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,060
<i>Hold on, boy!</i>

382
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,573
<i>Joe, you all right?</i>

383
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,513
<i>You know who did that,
that asshole Willie.</i>

384
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,114
<i>He's crazy.</i>

385
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,251
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

386
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,686
ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

387
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,323
<i>Can we go now?</i>

388
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,492
<i>What you doing?</i>

389
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:19,229
Where you gonna go?

390
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,531
We're gonna go into town
and get some food. Come on.

391
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,133
Get something to eat with what?

392
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,135
We ain't got hardly nothing here.

393
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,604
Well, it ain't much,
but it's something.

394
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:31,408
- Come on.
- I ain't getting up.

395
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,777
Are you drunk?

396
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,746
No, I ain't drunk.

397
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,249
- I know you drunk.
- <i>No, I ain't drunk.</i>

398
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,118
You're like, "I ain't drunk."

399
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,154
I ain't take
my medicine today, boy.

400
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:48,825
- I didn't take my medicine today.
- "I'm just tired."

401
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,595
"I ain't drunk."

402
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,264
- <i>Come on, get up.</i>
<i>- Uh, no.</i>

403
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,499
Come on.

404
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,436
Come on, get up.

405
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,905
Come on, please?
You'll be all right.

406
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,507
Come on. I'll help you up.

407
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,575
You can make it.

408
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:13,650
Yeah. No... you know what?

409
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:17,320
I'm gonna sit right here
in the dirt.

410
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,789
I'm gonna teach you
a little about break dancing.

411
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,925
You ever see break dancing before?

412
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,294
You know what "pop" and
you know what "locking" is?

413
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,829
Huh, do you, bud?

414
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,332
Take this hand right here,
pretend it's going over a wave

415
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,934
like you're out there in the ocean.

416
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,702
You floating. Come on, son.

417
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,237
<i>You floating out in the ocean.</i>

418
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:38,175
Whoa. Tidal wave coming
across the other side.

419
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:41,344
Here we go. Oh, yeah.
We're waving now.

420
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,780
Bring it back up.
Here comes the big one.

421
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:48,385
Ow-oo! Yeah. Here it is. Hey! Hey!

422
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,954
Oh, now, now. That shit
ain't funny right there.

423
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,355
That shit ain't funny at all.

424
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,958
I'll come get it now.

425
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,328
You want it. You want it?

426
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,663
I'm not through with my lesson.

427
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,432
Life's lesson. You only
learned about waving.

428
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,201
<i>Popping.</i>
<i>You ever see popping?</i>

429
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:07,904
Pop. That's pop. You
know what locking is?

430
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,272
I really can't do
a whole lot of locking

431
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,709
unless I'm standing and...

432
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,977
Stand up. Come on.

433
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,845
I don't see myself
doing much of that

434
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,249
in the near future there, son.

435
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,517
I know you drunk 'cause
you about to spill it.

436
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,653
Oh, did I spill it?
I need a pillow.

437
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,623
Ah. There we go.

438
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,558
<i>Yeah.</i>

439
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,295
One, two...

440
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,540
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

441
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:48,278
Hey, mister.

442
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,514
<i>Can you give me a ride?</i>

443
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,849
Say it again?

444
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,684
Me and my daddy was wondering

445
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,920
if you could give us
a ride back to town.

446
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,555
He ain't feelin' too good.

447
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,425
Shit, yeah.

448
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,794
Yeah, I'll give you boys a ride.

449
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,997
Come on. Where's your daddy at?

450
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,833
He's back that-away.

451
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:14,037
What you chunk that gun
off the bridge for?

452
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:20,443
I just threw it.

453
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,945
You know?

454
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:27,951
Weapons tend to make men
do violent things.

455
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:31,788
You know, guns...

456
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,292
knives, cannonballs...

457
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,827
little sticks of dynamite.

458
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:42,999
Hell, even automobiles.

459
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:49,873
Hey. Come here.

460
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,509
Look at my face.

461
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,312
You see that?

462
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,080
I see it.

463
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,683
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

464
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,686
and I don't give a fuck.

465
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,088
<i>Now, folks looking for trouble</i>

466
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,524
<i>tend to find more</i>
<i>than they're after,</i>

467
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:11,094
and I'll kill his fucking ass
if he ever slaps me again.

468
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,864
- You understand me?
- Who you talking about?

469
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,600
If he ever...

470
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:22,105
slaps me...

471
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,973
again.

472
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:38,488
Oh. You got any sisters?

473
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,892
- What?
- Sisters!

474
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,463
You got any sisters?

475
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:50,633
Is she pretty?

476
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,736
Mister, don't you talk
about my sister.

477
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:56,106
<i>Oh, well, shit.</i>

478
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:59,909
You're a tough little
sumbitch, ain't you?

479
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,578
Who the fuck you talking to, huh?

480
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,012
I'm talking to you, mister.

481
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,382
Don't you disrespect my family.

482
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:08,818
You know what I think?

483
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,421
I think I'm gonna say
whatever the fuck I wanna say.

484
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:15,091
You get the hell off me, mister.
I ain't done nothing to you.

485
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,563
I don't think I want to
give you that ride no more.

486
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,566
Mm-mm. I think I'm gonna take you

487
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,635
and I'm gonna throw
you off that bridge.

488
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,904
See how you like that, hmm?

489
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,906
Hmm?

490
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,811
Look at me, son. Look at my face.

491
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,013
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

492
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,715
and I don't give a fuck.

493
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,459
Look at me, you son of a bitch!

494
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,095
You stupid motherfucker,
you think I'm a kid?

495
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,830
You think I'm a goddamn kid?

496
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll beat your ass and
now you know it's true!

497
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,194
Quiet!

498
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,003
<i>Joe!</i>

499
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,912
Joe! Is he gonna bite me?

500
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,613
God damn it, would you shut up?

501
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,716
Shut up and get back under there!
Let these ladies alone.

502
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,718
Git!

503
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,689
Y'all come on. Dog won't bite.

504
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,729
That dog's crazy. What
if you hadn't been here?

505
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,131
If I hadn't been here,

506
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,632
you wouldn't have had no
business in my goddamn yard.

507
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,734
Damn, what happened to you?

508
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,938
Oh, hang on a minute.

509
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,079
The place is a mess, Joe.

510
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,149
<i>I wasn't expecting company.</i>

511
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,952
Well, we was just driving around,

512
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:31,287
<i>looking for something to do.</i>

513
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,090
Didn't know
if you'd be home or not.

514
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,893
Open up!

515
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,630
Are you all right?

516
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:17,066
I gotta quit smoking.

517
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,069
What the hell happened to you?

518
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,774
I slapped some asshole the
other night at the bar.

519
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,142
He come back and he shot me.

520
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,711
Jesus, Joe.

521
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,114
What, you and Willie Russell
be running around,

522
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,882
acting like kids again?

523
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,751
It's ridiculous.
I don't even remember

524
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,886
what set you off
in the first place.

525
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,759
Neither do I.

526
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,029
So what was it you
wanted to talk about?

527
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,397
You need some money?

528
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:51,768
No, nothing like that.

529
00:37:56,341 --> 00:38:01,010
You know that guy Frank? The guy?

530
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,879
He's back in town.

531
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,847
<i>And I don't want</i>
<i>to stay at my mama's.</i>

532
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,182
I thought she run him off.

533
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:09,018
<i>She did. Twice.</i>

534
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,988
But he called the other night.

535
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:16,959
Came back begging for forgiveness.

536
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,361
<i>She said he could stay</i>

537
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:21,230
<i>as long as he promised</i>
<i>to leave me alone.</i>

538
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,067
And he promised.

539
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:28,838
Just like he always does, but...

540
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:36,112
Still got your job
up at the cleaners?

541
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:44,253
- Good.
- <i>I wouldn't even hardly be here.</i>

542
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,491
I could take care of you...

543
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,828
<i>if you let me.</i>

544
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:56,165
I promise I won't even
tell her where I'm at.

545
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,767
You won't have to. She'll know.

546
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,504
She already called here
40 times looking for you.

547
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:09,912
You can stay with me
if you need to.

548
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:15,251
I can't promise you much,
but I'll try to be nice.

549
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,956
One, two, three, six, 11.

550
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,325
Get off your ass. You ain't
nothing but a number.

551
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,160
<i>Let's go, y'all.</i>

552
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:27,964
<i>Yo, Sam, where you been?
Haven't seen you around.</i>

553
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,032
You in those night school
classes or something?

554
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,434
Not yet.

555
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,970
Doing a little work on the side.

556
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,806
Trying to make a little extra
cash, get my shit together.

557
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,208
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, I know what you mean.

558
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,311
I know. We're just not good enough
for you anymore, are we, Sam?

559
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,247
I didn't say that.

560
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,216
Who these white folks
you got working?

561
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,521
<i>Yeah, I'm not sure. They
need work and I need help.</i>

562
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,357
<i>Young, old, black,</i>
<i>white, red, yellow.</i>

563
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,459
<i>I really don't give a shit, Sammy.</i>

564
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:59,462
Water. Where's your fucking water?

565
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:31,527
That's my water there.
Why you drinking my water?

566
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,930
Thirsty, that's why.

567
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,265
That's my personal water.

568
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,502
Why you drinking
my water up like that?

569
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:43,272
We're gonna have a problem
outta you all day, huh?

570
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,576
If I catch you with my water again,

571
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,345
<i>you're gonna have</i>
<i>a problem outta me.</i>

572
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,381
- Joe sent you down here with me?
- Yeah.

573
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,517
Let me help you with that pack.

574
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,886
The hell you use this thing for?

575
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:00,289
I'll show you how
to walk through it.

576
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,458
Man, this thing's heavy.

577
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,095
You use this lever right
here to pump out the poison.

578
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,965
You take this hatchet
and hit into the tree.

579
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:13,236
Let's see what you got.

580
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,371
Hit it right here.

581
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,939
Goddamn thing is leaking all over.

582
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,407
It happens sometimes.
Let's get to work.

583
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,409
Let's hit right here.

584
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,113
This is bullshit right here.

585
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,649
<i>Swing it.</i>

586
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,352
<i>You gotta swing it</i>
<i>harder than that.</i>

587
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,358
<i>Come on, man, get into it.</i>

588
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:35,057
<i>Man, this is some
stupid-ass shit, man.</i>

589
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,260
You know he can't even talk now.

590
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:41,964
Y'all niggas... y'all niggas didn't
eat it. I am hungry.

591
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,966
<i>Ain't gonna kill you with
our greenback there.</i>

592
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,193
<i>I don't want to know, Junior.</i>

593
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:48,104
I don't want to know about your king cobra,
okay? Or whatever you call it.

594
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,746
"Go Go Gadget Tongue,"
that's what he got.

595
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,542
You ever notice that
about your girl, man,

596
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,560
one of her breasts is bigger
than the other one, man?

597
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:58,247
- Wait a minute.
- No, one sit up here and the
other one sit down here?

598
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,417
<i>No comment, no comment.</i>

599
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,455
- <i>Don't go head first.</i>
<i>- I don't.</i>

600
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,181
<i>Don't go in there head first.</i>

601
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:11,160
<i>Tell the truth about them drips he
had, man, about that penicillin shot.</i>

602
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,663
<i>That's a lie! That's a damn lie!
That's a damn lie!</i>

603
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,434
Sure is a beautiful day
out here, ain't it?

604
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,969
It's all right.

605
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,370
Sitting here like the
angels sitting there

606
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,973
under this pretty sun.

607
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,641
Maybe I am an angel.

608
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,376
Yeah, but you gotta
go to work on my job.

609
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,012
You ain't on my job working.
Why you not working today?

610
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,048
What, did you come up here
to give me a hard time?

611
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,482
I been looking at you
all goddamn day,

612
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,617
and I see you up here
smoking a goddamn cigarette

613
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,185
watching the goddamn water.

614
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,954
You think you're a pretty
sumbitch out here,

615
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,356
and we gotta come out here to work.

616
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,324
I don't know why you
ain't trying to work.

617
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:43,292
I done all the work
I'm gonna do today.

618
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,294
So you ain't did shit
all goddamn day.

619
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,696
You ain't done a motherfucking...

620
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,298
- And who are you to tell me?
- I'm your goddamn boss.

621
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,233
As long as you here, I'm your boss.

622
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,601
You ain't my boss, and obviously

623
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,236
you can't even watch
what people are doing,

624
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,072
'cause if you saw anything,

625
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,474
you know I've been working all day.

626
00:42:57,475 --> 00:42:59,108
I've been working all damn day!

627
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:03,279
Yeah... no, you been on
your ass all goddamn day!

628
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,647
Who's gonna argue with who?

629
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,748
You ain't did shit all goddamn...

630
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,450
I'm trying to get you working!

631
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,517
Man, I worked my ass off!

632
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,486
You ain't did shit all goddamn day!

633
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:13,522
I told you, get to work! You're gonna
get your ass off my motherfucking job!

634
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,398
Well, you go tell Joe right now!
Go tell him, huh?

635
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:19,528
Joe goddamn gonna get rid of
you or do something different.

636
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,364
Something gonna change today

637
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,532
'cause tomorrow, we ain't
gonna have this bullshit.

638
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,634
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done with this bullshit.

639
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,303
Good, I'm glad you're done!

640
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:30,072
I'm glad you're done. Stay done.

641
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,610
Look like you got a yeast
infection on your goddamn face,

642
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,345
you country motherfucker!

643
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,565
Can you make it out of there?

644
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,635
Yeah, I'll make it, I guess.

645
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,304
Goddamn assholes.

646
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,108
Come here, son.

647
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,610
Help me get over this tailgate.

648
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,311
So what time you need us
back in the morning?

649
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,248
I don't need you
back in the morning.

650
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,716
What do you mean
you don't need us back?

651
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:16,652
We got the job done, didn't we?

652
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,221
This is yours there, son.

653
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,796
We got the job done.
Gary said we got the job.

654
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:28,397
Joe, I'll do anything you want.

655
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:32,568
Clear brush anytime, anywhere.
I can do it.

656
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,136
<i>Joe, I'd sure like
to work some more.</i>

657
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,573
Yeah, maybe later.
I'll let you know.

658
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,646
I don't know what you did

659
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,748
<i>that made that man mad, son.</i>

660
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,184
You hear me?

661
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,126
The hell you looking at?

662
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,311
Just another day.

663
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,580
It ain't his fault.

664
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:22,318
He loves us. Just...

665
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,721
He just goes through a hard time.

666
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,167
Well, I ain't gonna
watch him sit there

667
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,636
and hit you like he
hits me, you hear me?

668
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,638
Okay, Mama?

669
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,711
Ain't supposed to do
that to no one.

670
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:59,188
<i>You stay with your family.</i>

671
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,724
That's what you need to do.

672
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:05,327
You need to stay with your family.

673
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:11,600
Your family's all you got.

674
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,417
What was that?

675
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:30,719
I don't know.

676
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,956
- Didn't hear no car drive up.
- Probably ain't nobody.

677
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,959
Ain't nobody with
any sense out in this.

678
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,729
<i>- I'm just a medium.</i>
- Can't taste that.

679
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:48,204
<i>You want to go out tonight?</i>

680
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:50,773
Not really.

681
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:56,345
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

682
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,380
Hmm...

683
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:02,651
I don't know.

684
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,687
I was just wondering

685
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,689
if we were gonna do something.

686
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,560
I think you work too much.

687
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,664
You should get out.

688
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,334
Do something fun.

689
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,270
I hadn't planned on it.

690
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:23,872
Unless you want to.

691
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,880
We don't have to.

692
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:37,353
Ah...

693
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,787
There's someone out there.

694
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:43,359
No. No, wait. Hold this.

695
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,804
Hey, Joe, can you put that dog up?

696
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,907
Oh, hell, I know who it is.

697
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,879
Boy, you're soaking-ass wet.

698
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,282
What'd you plan to do,
stand there all night?

699
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:08,550
He should get out
of them wet clothes.

700
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,286
- He'll get sick.
- I'm all right.

701
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:11,854
I just... I just wanted to come by

702
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,356
- and talk to you about working some more.
- Work?

703
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,824
Don't you see what it's
doing out there?

704
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,527
Yes, sir.

705
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,030
Hey, where's my drink at?
You got any trousers he can wear?

706
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:22,431
What size waist you got?

707
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:25,634
I think I have some
cool pants he can wear.

708
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,539
I bet nobody come mess 'round
here with that dog out there.

709
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,974
<i>Well, that's why I got the dog.</i>

710
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,543
The dog won't bother anybody
just walking down the road.

711
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,312
Road ain't dogs.

712
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:37,579
<i>Dog knows what's dogs.</i>

713
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,847
<i>You could have just walked on off,</i>

714
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,049
<i>the dog wouldn't</i>
<i>have done anything.</i>

715
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:42,451
All right, here. Try these on.

716
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,920
I think they'll fit you.

717
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,057
The bathroom's this way.

718
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,792
<i>The dog is a good dog.</i>

719
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:53,429
Yeah. That dog scared
the hell out of me, though.

720
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,432
He's all beat up.

721
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,101
Mm-hmm. His daddy.

722
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,570
Saw him do it.

723
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,573
You what?

724
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:07,476
What, you just sat there

725
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,745
and watched it, or what?

726
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,748
He's a big kid.

727
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:18,721
I can't get my hands dirty
in every little thing.

728
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:20,422
You know how I get.

729
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,990
You're a grown man, Joe.

730
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,360
What is that supposed to mean?

731
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:26,929
It can mean whatever
you want it to mean.

732
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:29,631
Don't fool yourself
too much about me.

733
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,673
<i>Hey, there you go.</i>

734
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,007
You look like a million bucks.

735
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,611
<i>Feel better now?</i>

736
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,381
I feel like a hundred bucks.

737
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:48,517
Come by 'cause I wanted to
talk to you about my job.

738
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:52,888
I wanna work. I need a job.

739
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,924
My daddy don't care
if he gots a job, but I do.

740
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,894
You'd work in this rain,
wouldn't you?

741
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,431
If you need me to.

742
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,470
Let me slip my shoes on.
I'll run you back home.

743
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,180
Hey, we'll be there
in just a second, okay?

744
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,817
Hey.

745
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:24,686
You know you don't have to take
no shit from nobody, right?

746
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,023
You know that, right?

747
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,025
Yes, ma'am.

748
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:34,196
Good. Now let's go.

749
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,834
- How you been, Chris?
- Good, how about you?

750
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:39,691
Doing all right.

751
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:42,471
- You still doing the mixed martial arts?
- Yes, sir.

752
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,640
What you doing
out in the rain, Joe?

753
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,743
Oh, I need two pounds of ham

754
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:50,679
- and a pound of Swiss cheese sliced up.
- All right.

755
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:51,880
Come on, you get the cheese,
I'll get the ham.

756
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:56,552
Yes, sir. Looks like every time I get a
little ahead, it starts in raining again.

757
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,994
Here you go.

758
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,163
Well, it's not much. Now look here.

759
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,632
When it dries up,

760
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,068
you come down here early
in the morning, 'fore light,

761
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,956
and I'll pick you up
and take you to work.

762
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:17,105
We got plenty to do when
the weather gets right.

763
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,242
You got a clock? No, you wouldn't.

764
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,845
All right, I'll find you a
wind-up clock or something.

765
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,146
All right, then.

766
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:25,747
Thank you, sir.

767
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,749
No, you don't need to call
me "sir" all the time.

768
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,653
I'm your friend, you understand?

769
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,789
All right. Hey, where's his ham?

770
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,158
<i>- Hang on, we're coming.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

771
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,213
Ahem.

772
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:12,027
What are you thinking, Joe?

773
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,031
Nothing.

774
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:21,036
There's nothing I can do,
and I hate it.

775
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,674
That's not true.

776
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:29,044
Yeah, it is.

777
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:34,816
<i>You look at me like
I can make a move.</i>

778
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,052
<i>What are you thinking when</i>
<i>you look at me like that?</i>

779
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:40,722
<i>Don't you care?</i>

780
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,190
<i>I don't know who I am.</i>

781
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:51,767
<i>But I know what keeps
me alive is restraint.</i>

782
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,003
<i>It keeps me out of jail.</i>

783
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,706
<i>Keeps me from hurting people.</i>

784
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,683
Hey.

785
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:12,621
<i>The mark of some fucked-up
faith that there is a reason.</i>

786
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:13,755
Thank you.

787
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:17,059
<i>A reason for all of this.</i>

788
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:21,063
<i>A reason in most moments
I shouldn't do what I want to do.</i>

789
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:26,101
<i>I do as I'm told.</i>

790
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:32,274
<i>These men who bust their asses</i>
<i>work like dogs.</i>

791
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:37,946
<i>I believe in them,</i>
<i>but every day, they hurt.</i>

792
00:53:39,148 --> 00:53:42,317
<i>They get old, they peel back.</i>

793
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:48,624
<i>There's no frontier anymore.</i>

794
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,258
Allan.

795
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,694
Clark.

796
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,097
Gary.

797
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,300
<i>And I watch that boy,</i>

798
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:01,269
<i>and I see someone</i>
<i>who's nothing like me,</i>

799
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:06,341
<i>but he's a child</i>
<i>folks left behind...</i>

800
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,778
<i>with no defense.</i>

801
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,016
<i>Balanced right there.</i>

802
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,686
What do you want?

803
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:28,163
<i>- What is it you want?</i>
<i>- Nothing.</i>

804
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,836
<i>Just tell me what I can do.</i>

805
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,741
<i>I like you.</i>

806
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:45,280
<i>I like you too, but what's
the point in any of it?</i>

807
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,423
<i>Fuck to this day.</i>

808
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:57,726
<i>I mean, fuck to this day.</i>

809
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:06,268
<i>It's all just gonna boil up</i>
<i>and wash us away.</i>

810
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,876
<i>And he'll still be here.</i>

811
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,749
<i>Or maybe he won't.</i>

812
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,995
Damn, Joe, why do you keep loading all
these fools in this little truck?

813
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,430
Good to have you
with us again, Sammy.

814
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:36,898
You drop down any more,
we're gonna have to

815
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,500
get out and push,
and I ain't pushing shit.

816
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,969
I thought you had your
eye on a new truck, Joe.

817
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:42,738
I ain't getting no new truck.

818
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,240
- You need one.
- No, I don't.

819
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:47,776
If you get a new truck, how
much you want for this old one?

820
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,444
You mean this old piece of junk?

821
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,781
Smell like somebody done
died up in there. It's nasty.

822
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,182
I don't mind the smell. I like it.

823
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,084
It smells good to me.

824
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,320
Yeah, but this thing...

825
00:55:58,322 --> 00:56:01,490
I spend as much time working
on it as I do driving it.

826
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:04,326
'Course there ain't
nothing major wrong with it.

827
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:06,828
Just little shit. You know,
it needs some brakes.

828
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,964
It needs a new...

829
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:13,168
Joe, come on.

830
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,036
I'll buy it from you.
I'll work my butt off.

831
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,339
I love the truck. You have
to give it to me now.

832
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:21,009
Well, I mean, it's got
a lot of miles on it.

833
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,911
You'd be better finding
one in town somewhere.

834
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:25,380
I don't want one in town.
I like that one.

835
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,818
Come on, Joe.

836
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:33,922
All right. I'll take $900 for it...

837
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,991
if I get a new truck.

838
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:37,325
All right. Shake hands.

839
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,361
That's what I'm talking about.
Heck, yeah.

840
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,329
<i>All right, hey, y'all, let's go!</i>

841
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,428
Hey, what you got there?

842
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,390
Hey.

843
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:50,358
I was wondering if maybe
you could tell me

844
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,227
how to get down to Water Valley.

845
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:55,630
<i>My wife, she's in</i>
<i>the hospital down there.</i>

846
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,199
<i>I just now got here.</i>

847
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,036
<i>You know how far it is?</i>

848
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:06,174
Is that the highway
that goes to it?

849
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:09,311
<i>Is it?</i>

850
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:10,979
What you drinking?

851
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:14,983
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

852
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,556
You ain't drinking
some wine, are you?

853
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,391
I may.

854
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,960
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

855
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:28,129
Some folks think a feller
ought not drink at all,

856
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,598
but a little drink
never hurt nobody.

857
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,968
That's right.

858
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:36,471
I get me a little drink every now and
then when I'm down at the house,

859
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:39,074
but the old lady, she raises
so much sand about it,

860
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,743
I don't do a lot
of drinking down there.

861
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:45,080
I usually wait till I get
uptown like I am now.

862
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,415
Grab me a drink.

863
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:51,753
She all right?

864
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,621
Yeah, yeah. She is today.

865
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:58,026
That's why I'm trying to get down there
to Water Valley, go see about her.

866
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:00,161
I was supposed
to have got paid today,

867
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,064
but the old fella,
he never showed up,

868
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:07,135
you know, so I think I'll
go get me a little drink,

869
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:10,438
go down to Water Valley
and go see how she's doing.

870
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,674
She in the hospital?

871
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:16,511
Yeah, she's in the hospital.
She got cancer.

872
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:19,347
Just eat up with it all over.

873
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,616
You know.

874
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,085
Damn thing, you know,
a person just don't know

875
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,754
from one day to the next

876
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:28,223
which one's gonna be their last.

877
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,097
Well, it's a beautiful
day out there.

878
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,700
Feeling a little chill in my bones.

879
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:41,636
I think it's fixing to rain.

880
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,406
<i>It's probably fixing to rain some.</i>

881
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,277
<i>Three African painted dogs...</i>

882
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:34,816
wild dogs... killed a
three-year-old in the zoo.

883
01:02:34,818 --> 01:02:39,354
This toddler, he fell
in, hit his head,

884
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:42,657
and the dogs got him.

885
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:45,860
Where was everybody?

886
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,807
A little kid.

887
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,852
Hello, Joe.

888
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:13,288
How you doing?

889
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:19,494
Oh. Sumbitch.

890
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:24,432
I'll tell you what, buddy.

891
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:28,469
All this goddamn back and
forth and back and forth.

892
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,840
I'm fucking over it.

893
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,343
Yeah, well...

894
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,784
Maybe it's time we just... bygones.

895
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:51,693
You know I could have
killed you, right?

896
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:53,628
I could have killed you,
but I didn't.

897
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:57,265
I licked you. I was aiming
for the trees, see?

898
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:59,801
That shot was meant
as a warning shot,

899
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:02,270
'cause all you keep doing
is embarrassing me

900
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:05,273
in front of my goddamn friends.

901
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,375
I mean, hell, the last
time you slapped me,

902
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:11,346
there was ladies and gentlemen
present.

903
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,617
So what's this shit I hear

904
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:19,454
about this kid you got
working for you, huh?

905
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:24,993
Little drifter kid,
about yea big, hmm?

906
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:27,428
I don't really
give a shit about him,

907
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,799
but I suspect you know
where he lives, don't you?

908
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,936
No.

909
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:37,805
Huh.

910
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,441
What's wrong, Spooky?

911
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,344
You still sore at me?

912
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:02,830
Christy, call the cops
'fore somebody gets killed.

913
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,767
Would you do that for me, honey?

914
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,856
<i>Hold on.</i>

915
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:35,430
Get back. Hold it! Hey, Joe.

916
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,833
- Is Merle around?
- Merle ain't here.

917
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:42,103
- You all right?
- I want to get blown, but...

918
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,706
Oh, that's right,
you don't like dogs, do you?

919
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:47,575
That's not true. I love dogs.
Just not <i>that</i> dog.

920
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,511
- That dog is an <i>asshole!</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, Joe.</i>

921
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,613
Y'all help me get this
fucking dog out of here!

922
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,352
Joe!

923
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:00,955
<i>Joe!</i>

924
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:00,782
<i>You busy?</i>

925
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:02,984
Come on.

926
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:25,673
You got any pets?

927
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:28,576
- I mean, I had a cat.
- A cat? Wonderful.

928
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,445
- What's its name?
- Lucy.

929
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:33,080
- What'd you feed it?
- I don't know, fucking dry food.

930
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,117
- What's your favorite color?
- Red.

931
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,985
Blow me.

932
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,987
All right.

933
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,924
Let me just focus on the snowflake.

934
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:45,726
- Snowflake on the wall.
- All right, snowflake.

935
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:06,047
All right, all right, all right.

936
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,818
- I beg your pardon.
- <i>All right, baby.</i>

937
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,954
It's all right.

938
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,792
You don't have to run off.

939
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:20,127
I mean, you can stick
around if you want.

940
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,264
Joe?

941
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:29,871
Dog.

942
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:16,717
Pull over. Pull over now!

943
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:47,148
- Come on. Come on, let's go!
- Freeze!

944
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,283
<i>Don't move!</i>

945
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:50,818
<i>Freeze, Joe!</i>

946
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,888
What? Put the gun down.

947
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:55,890
Be a man about it
and show me what you got.

948
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:58,726
- We got you surrounded, Joe.
- Hey, I'm just one dude.

949
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,095
Freeze, Joe. Put your
hands behind your head.

950
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:02,763
Come on, what are you gonna do?

951
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,231
- Look, I don't have nothing on me, man.
- Freeze.

952
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,767
Why don't you guys
both be like big boys

953
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,803
and put your guns down
and let's talk about it?

954
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:11,072
That's all I'm gonna do. Just
talk about it, all right?

955
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:13,174
Come on. Who's gonna cuff me?

956
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:16,010
<i>What do you got?</i>
<i>I'm feeling real good today.</i>

957
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:19,714
<i>Hey, Joe. You in there, Joe?</i>

958
01:10:23,885 --> 01:10:26,921
<i>Coming in, Joe.</i>

959
01:10:28,156 --> 01:10:30,124
<i>Joe here?</i>

960
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:34,061
You seen Joe? Huh?

961
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,796
What you think, man?

962
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,932
You think Joe is gonna
take care of you?

963
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:42,403
You think Joe's your daddy?
Is that what you think?

964
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,006
Joe ain't your daddy.
<i>I'm</i> your daddy.

965
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:48,976
I'm the one taking care of you.

966
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,745
You got some money?

967
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,880
I know you got some
money hid around here.

968
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:54,382
Where's your money at?

969
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:57,218
I ain't got no damn money.
Joe didn't give me none today.

970
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,120
Really?

971
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:00,988
Give me some money.

972
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,991
I just told you,
I ain't got no damn money.

973
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:12,767
Ain't got no money, huh?

974
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,135
Got food.

975
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:16,170
Got food, goddamn it.

976
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:18,205
You got food, but you ain't
got no fucking money.

977
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,174
How did you get the food?

978
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:30,151
What the hell you stumbling for?

979
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:33,020
You can't even take care
of your damn self.

980
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,862
Hey, that's my shit!

981
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:46,367
Knock your shit off, boy.

982
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:49,003
Knock your shit off.

983
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:54,341
Fuck.

984
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,411
You ain't got no
motherfucking money, huh?

985
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,181
Oh, hey.

986
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:01,949
Look at that, huh?

987
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:04,185
What you... oh, yeah!

988
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:07,988
Yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

989
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,291
That's kind of what
I fucking thought.

990
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:14,295
- Bring it, motherfucker.
- Get the fuck back off me.

991
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:22,236
How's that, huh?

992
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:27,441
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

993
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,176
<i>Yeah.</i>

994
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,512
<i>What?</i>
<i>Don't seem to be talking...</i>

995
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,315
doing a whole lot
of talking right now.

996
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:37,251
Kinda look like you in bad shape.

997
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:39,453
Who the hell you think you are? You
ain't my daddy, you motherfucker!

998
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,957
Look at me! You seen what I did to
that motherfucker on the bridge?

999
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,525
I'll beat your ass!

1000
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:50,431
Son of a bitch!

1001
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,400
I'm about through messing with you!

1002
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,402
I been out looking
for fucking money!

1003
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,505
I been out looking
for a fucking job

1004
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:59,840
to feed your worthless
fucking face!

1005
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:04,011
Yeah. You stupid,
little piece of shit.

1006
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,886
Yeah.

1007
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,355
<i>I know you got money</i>
<i>hid around here, boy.</i>

1008
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:17,391
You know what? I'm gonna come back.

1009
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,293
I'm gonna get it.

1010
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:22,463
I'm gonna find it
and I'm gonna get it.

1011
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,922
Hey, wake it up, wake it up.

1012
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:50,357
Earl, please, give me
a goddamn cigarette, man.

1013
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:54,195
Please. I'm begging you.

1014
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:55,896
You're on your way
out of here anyway, man.

1015
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,598
All right.

1016
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,067
- I called your bondsman for you.
- Thanks, buddy.

1017
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:01,468
How come he's getting out of here?

1018
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:06,307
Aw, knock it off, Cokie!
Knock it off!

1019
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:09,143
Oh, man, thank you so much, buddy.

1020
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,081
Thank you, buddy.

1021
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:25,526
- What do they got me charged with?
- Shit, a heap. DUI,

1022
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:28,996
assaulting an officer, resisting arrest.
You want some more shit?

1023
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:30,564
Oh, oh... you know
where they took my truck?

1024
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,933
There's a kid who wants my truck.

1025
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:36,270
Wasn't here last night. We
can sure find out, though.

1026
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,275
You were, 32 when you went
to the pen the first time.

1027
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:43,377
What are you now, 48, 49?

1028
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:47,081
- 48.
- Getting old, Joe.

1029
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:51,085
Be a lot harder on you every
time from here on out.

1030
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:54,588
But who am I to tell you
how to live your life?

1031
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:58,158
Yeah. That's a good one.

1032
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,061
Come on, man. Come
on, get it together.

1033
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:03,564
Shit, man. You kidding me?

1034
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:05,599
Yeah, I'd like to get
a number on a...

1035
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:09,069
like, a dog rescue, or...

1036
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:13,474
You don't have a number
on a dog rescue?

1037
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:16,944
Well, I'm reporting a lost dog.

1038
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:20,948
Yeah. It's an American bulldog.

1039
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:23,183
Brown and white. Female.

1040
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,519
90 pounds.

1041
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,296
What are you doing here?

1042
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:38,198
Um...

1043
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,000
Mr. Coleman told me

1044
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,937
you got into a little
trouble with some cops.

1045
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:45,306
That all you heard?

1046
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:50,044
They said you got put
up at that jail too.

1047
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,552
You don't still want
my truck, do you?

1048
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:04,158
Yes, sir.

1049
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,160
You do?

1050
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,235
They said you got put up
at the big jail one time.

1051
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:19,206
- Coleman told you that?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1052
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,742
Yeah, I have.

1053
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:24,244
I did 29 months in the penitentiary

1054
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,513
for assault on a police officer.

1055
01:16:30,618 --> 01:16:35,356
They pulled me over behind
a shopping center uptown.

1056
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:37,491
This one officer...

1057
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:40,494
some pretty-boy type guy...
had some issue with me.

1058
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:42,596
He thought I had something to do
with one of the girls he knew.

1059
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,599
I didn't know what the
hell he was talking about.

1060
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:49,203
<i>Then they tried to shoot me</i>

1061
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:52,039
<i>after I beat the shit</i>
<i>out of all three of them.</i>

1062
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:55,509
Or one did.

1063
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:58,479
Deputy went for his gun
and I grabbed it.

1064
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:03,017
And...

1065
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:06,687
well, he was fixing to kill me.
He told me he was.

1066
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:13,227
All he did was blow
his kneecap off.

1067
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:15,329
Jackass.

1068
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:20,034
My dog run off last night.

1069
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:21,502
You want to go look for her?

1070
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:23,404
Sure.

1071
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:29,576
You want me to drive the truck?

1072
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:31,779
You gotta start sometime.

1073
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:34,381
Don't look at them.
Don't wave to them,

1074
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,383
<i>'cause they know you're guilty
of something when you wave.</i>

1075
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,546
Yes, sir.

1076
01:17:37,772 --> 01:17:41,188
<i>A cop can mess you
up if he wants to.</i>

1077
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:45,492
Yeah, I made the mistakes, but they're the
ones that won't ever let me live it down.

1078
01:17:47,495 --> 01:17:49,696
Hey, can I buy one of
them beers off you?

1079
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:53,367
Oh, I don't know. Uh...

1080
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:57,204
you can <i>drink</i> one of these beers,
but you cannot buy one from me.

1081
01:17:57,206 --> 01:18:00,307
Friends don't ever need
to buy things from me.

1082
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,378
There you go. Nice and cold.

1083
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,246
Keep your eyes peeled.

1084
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,116
For the cops or the dog?

1085
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:09,618
Both.

1086
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,089
"Cops or the dog."

1087
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:17,291
You hear that?

1088
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,460
That's the sound that
gets the hookers excited

1089
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:21,261
'cause they know you got cash.

1090
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,263

All right, anatomy of a cool face.

1094
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,609
Make a face of pain.

No, smile on top of the pain.

Hold the pain. Smile through it.

1103
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,128
Now, I used to know a girl
who lived around here.

Shit. Where's my dog?

1105
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,132
I raised that dog from a pup.

1106
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,737
- Dog!
- There's a lot of construction here

1107
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,539
'cause they're building
that Hindu temple.

1108

Has long ears, with a docked tail.

1125
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:52,486
What was that?

1126
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:55,189
Yes, ma'am, I meant to get
around to doing that,

1127
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:57,925
but I did a halfway job on my dog.

1128

- A halfway job?
- <i>Halfway, ma'am.</i>

- <i>Halfway.</i>

- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

1131
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:09,403
So, I'm missing my dog,
and the dog is...

you want some of this?

No, uh-uh. That stuff

<i>Well, I'm a pretty
long way from crazy.</i>

1135
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,877
<i>But my dog's about 100
pounds, brown and white.</i>

- Looks like a cow.
- Looks like a cow?

1137
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,348
- Right.
- You have a dog that looks like a cow?

01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:22,783
Well, it's not that big a deal.

1139
01:20:22,785 --> 01:20:24,918
A lot of dogs look like cows.
But here's the thing.

1140
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,687

- Okay.

1143
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:35,329
Have we already drove past that
place where you last saw your dog?

1144
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,265
- No. Why?
- I think the dog will be there.

1145

No, the dog run off.

01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,176
That's the hardest fucking
work I ever done in my life.

1191
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:11,878
Is it?

1192
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,816
- Yeah. You paying my boy?
- What?

1193
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:18,452
- Are you paying my boy?
- Hell, yeah.

1194
01:24:18,454 --> 01:24:20,587
I ain't seen he got paid none.

1195
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:22,856
<i>Probably saves it</i>
<i>'cause he's smart.</i>

1196
01:24:22,858 --> 01:24:24,891
Buying this GMC off of me.

1197
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,794
Doing what?

1198
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:30,197
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

1199
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:34,034
He ain't so smart.
He don't know nothing.

1200
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:37,938
<i>Hell, neither do you.</i>

1201
01:24:40,908 --> 01:24:43,910
I'm gonna shoot you straight.

1202
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:51,184
That boy works his ass off!

1203
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:55,589
He's earning money and it's <i>his!</i>

1204
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:59,125
If this truck's a piece of shit,
you need to get out of it.

1205
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,862
And if I find out something's
happened to that boy,

1206
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:05,866
I'm gonna whip whoever's ass
had something to do with it.

1207
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:08,568
Now get the hell away from me

1208
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,071
before I knock what's left
of your fucking teeth out.

1209
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:38,732
I had the funniest thought today.

1210
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:46,072
I thought

1211
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:49,676
maybe you and I
could go out to dinner.

1212
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:54,614
You know?

1213
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:57,050
Get all dressed up.

1214
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,289
Maybe you could...

1215
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:05,091
hold the door open for me.

1216
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,337
I think that would be nice.

1217
01:26:22,843 --> 01:26:27,581
You pretend to be asleep, but...

1218
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:31,084
I know you'd cry if
I said the wrong thing.

1219
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:59,312
<i>You know this place
is condemned, right?</i>

1220
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:01,381
<i>You can't just take</i>
<i>the boards off windows</i>

1221
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,950
<i>and call a place home.</i>

1222
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:11,257
Gary, why do you
stick around like this?

1223
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:15,228
You're old enough, smart
enough to do your own thing.

1224
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,963
What's most important right now

1225
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:20,233
is me taking care of
Dorothy and Mama,

1226
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:25,639
'cause... we kind of got a
family problem right now.

1227
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:32,412
<i>Hey there.</i>

1228
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,948
Hey now.

1229
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:37,283
Don't talk much, does she?

1230
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:41,054
- She don't talk at all.
- What do you mean?

1231
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,758
I don't know. Nobody knows.
She just stopped one day.

1232
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,161
I mean, she used to would, but...

1233
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:57,904
<i>Well, hey, I'm ready to
make this deal if you are.</i>

1234
01:27:57,906 --> 01:28:01,041
- Yeah.
- I got my money.

1235
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:05,111
Hey, "G-Daawg."

1236
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:09,315
Don't you think
I forgot about it, bud.

1237
01:28:10,851 --> 01:28:14,721
I've been looking for
you and that kid.

1238
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:17,023
That boy of yours,

1239
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:19,693
he sure thinks he knows something.

1240
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:21,394
I know you, mister.

1241
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:24,230
You my friend?

1242
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,866
I ain't your friend.

1243
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:29,969
Well, you like to make
all them funny faces.

1244
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,404
I said, are you my friend?

1245
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:34,974
Listen, buddy.

1246
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,409
I think I know a way

1247
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:39,412
that you and me can be friends.

1248
01:28:45,886 --> 01:28:48,855
There it is.

1249
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,493
It looks just like your old one.

1250
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,428
It's periwinkle blue. I like it.

1251
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:59,032
I hope so.

1252
01:28:59,034 --> 01:29:01,901
Well, you got plenty
of gas to get home.

1253
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,403
You might want to stop at Coleman's

1254
01:29:03,405 --> 01:29:06,039
and put a little more in it
if you plan to ride around.

1255
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:09,142
- Here.
- What's that?

1256
01:29:09,144 --> 01:29:10,343
It's the money for the truck.

1257
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,146
Oh, hell, I ain't worried about that.
You just stick it back in your pocket.

1258
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:16,149
You're gonna need it for insurance.

1259
01:29:16,151 --> 01:29:18,852
- What's insurance?
- Well, yeah, it's the law.

1260
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,120
You can't drive without insurance.

1261
01:29:20,122 --> 01:29:23,389
You're covered now, but when I sign it
over, you gotta pick up the insurance.

1262
01:29:23,415 --> 01:29:25,525
I'll tell you what. You come
out to the house before long,

1263
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:28,194
we'll get you fixed up.
I'm gonna go on.

1264
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,462
- You gonna be all right?
- Yes, sir.

1265
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:30,930
<i>All right.</i>

1266
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:35,835
- Uh, you want me to follow you?
- Nah, I'll be all right.

1267
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:40,507
Hey, Joe.

1268
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:41,808
Thanks.

1269
01:31:05,926 --> 01:31:09,162
- Nice truck.
- Thanks.

1270
01:31:09,164 --> 01:31:11,130
<i>You ain't got any tags on it.
You just get it?</i>

1271
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,298
Yeah.

1272
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,466
You want to breathe
into this for me?

1273
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,001
No, I don't want to
breathe into that.

1274
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:16,469
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

1275
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:19,072
<i>Hey!</i>

1276
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:20,874
Hey!

1277
01:31:50,537 --> 01:31:52,538
Pull over!

1278
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:55,308
Pull over!

1279
01:32:05,085 --> 01:32:07,153
God damn it!

1280
01:32:07,155 --> 01:32:08,554
I ain't done a goddamn thing!

1281
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:10,423
- Stay in your vehicle!
- <i>I ain't drunk!</i>

1282
01:32:10,425 --> 01:32:12,226
You better look for
someone else to mess with,

1283
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:14,193
- 'cause I did <i>nothing!</i>
- Put your hands behind your back!

1284
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,982
If you and your motherfucking friends
keep messing around with me,

1285
01:32:16,008 --> 01:32:18,631
- I'm going to hurt you!
- Put your hands behind your back!

1286
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:19,632
Come here!

1287
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,703
I guess if I drive off now,
you're gonna get your shotgun

1288
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,104
out of the back and shoot me, huh?

1289
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:26,239
- No.
- You gonna shoot me?

1290
01:32:26,241 --> 01:32:28,441
- No!
- You can do it.

1291
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:09,315
That was quick.

1292
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:13,686
Still got that badass dog?
Yeah. 'Round here somewhere.

1293
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,123
Hold on a minute.

1294
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,491
Don't worry, okay? Don't worry,

1295
01:33:18,493 --> 01:33:22,595
don't worry, don't worry.

1296
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,664
All right.

1297
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:30,036
Hear you got a new grandbaby.

1298
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:31,270
I do?

1299
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:35,408
- Yeah, you didn't know?
- Not till now.

1300
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:36,776
Huh. Yeah, a little boy.

1301
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:39,679
Morrissey saw him in church.

1302
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:43,616
<i>Said he looked just like
you'd expect him to look.</i>

1303
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,122
<i>She said he's got your eyes.</i>

1304
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:53,159
You okay?

1305
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:56,095
Your son's all grown now, ain't he?

1306
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:57,563
Yeah. All grown up.

1307
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,699
What's he going into,
law enforcement?

1308
01:33:59,701 --> 01:34:02,668
That's what I heard.

1309
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:06,406
You got a new man working
for you now, don't you?

1310
01:34:06,408 --> 01:34:09,642
Yes, I do. Believe you've met him.

1311
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:12,111
Gung-ho fella. A little overeager.

1312
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:16,149
- He was looking for someone to fuck with.
- <i>Yeah, maybe so.</i>

1313
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,317
<i>I'll have his ass shuffling
papers for a while</i>

1314
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,254
till he learns to
cool down a little bit.

1315
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:24,690
But that ain't what
I'm worried about.

1316
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:27,727
Can you pass the hot sauce?

1317
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:31,497
Let me ask you a question, Joe,

1318
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:34,500
'cause I really want to know.

1319
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,602
Why do you want to go back?

1320
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:40,173
Why do you want to go back to
the damn penitentiary, man?

1321
01:34:44,611 --> 01:34:47,413
<i>'Cause you can't keep</i>
<i>going to folks' houses,</i>

1322
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:50,750
<i>killing their dogs, no matter
what else is going on.</i>

1323
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:53,786
And you can't keep
fistfighting the law.

1324
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:55,455
Judge won't put up with it.

1325
01:34:55,457 --> 01:34:57,190
He don't have to put up with it.

1326
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:59,659
That's why they built prisons.

1327
01:35:05,165 --> 01:35:08,134
Now you done got me back
to smoking, damn it.

1328
01:35:08,136 --> 01:35:09,669
<i>I been quit for three weeks.</i>

1329
01:35:13,108 --> 01:35:15,374
I haven't mistreated you, Joe.

1330
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,377
Have I? Tell the truth.

1331
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:22,782
No, Earl. You stuck up
for me when you could.

1332
01:35:22,784 --> 01:35:25,852
And I used to be as bad as you.

1333
01:35:25,854 --> 01:35:29,489
At one time, you were worse.

1334
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:34,660
Yeah, but I'm cool now.

1335
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,441
Connie, where'd you go, baby?

1336
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,312
Answer the phone next time.

1337
01:35:57,385 --> 01:35:59,852
Hi.

1338
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,714
<i>Yo presiento que Joe está aqui.</i>

1339
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:32,718
Joe, is that you?
<i>¿Estás aqui?</i>

1340
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,975
Yeah, it's me.

1341
01:37:16,296 --> 01:37:18,397
Oh, shit.

1342
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:20,266
What happened?

1343
01:37:20,268 --> 01:37:22,702
I need to borrow the truck.

1344
01:37:22,704 --> 01:37:24,971
What happened to you?

1345
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:26,539
I'm gonna kill him.

1346
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:29,275
I'm gonna kill that
old son of a bitch.

1347
01:37:29,277 --> 01:37:31,711
You think I won't, but I will.

1348
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:36,349
And I'ma get mine back.

1349
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:39,552
I just need to borrow that truck.

1350
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:40,987
Come inside.

1351
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:52,298
Don't touch me.

1352
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,000
I should have given you
a boxing lesson.

1353
01:37:54,002 --> 01:37:55,768
I don't need no
goddamn boxing lesson.

1354
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:58,971
I know what to do. I'll
pop him right in the eye.

1355
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:03,643
He whupped my ass and
threw me out of the truck

1356
01:38:03,645 --> 01:38:05,544
'cause he knew that
I were gonna kill him!

1357
01:38:09,549 --> 01:38:12,451
I can kill his ass.

1358
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,687
I can kill him just
as good as you could.

1359
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:17,757
I know you could, I know you could.

1360
01:38:17,759 --> 01:38:19,058
I know it.

1361
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,961
But you don't have to do that.

1362
01:38:21,963 --> 01:38:23,829
Okay, son?

1363
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:26,866
Just stay here with me.

1364
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:30,436
You'll be safe here.

1365
01:38:30,438 --> 01:38:32,338
Bring your mama and your sister.

1366
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:35,574
He gots Dorothy.

1367
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,743
He done run off with her.

1368
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,011
He met up with some bad men.

1369
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:41,547
I heard him talking about it.

1370
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:44,417
That man with the
scarred-up face...

1371
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:47,353
the one that I beat
down by the bridge?

1372
01:38:49,389 --> 01:38:52,558
He been looking for me
for what I done did to him.

1373
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,329
She don't hurt nobody, Joe.

1374
01:38:56,331 --> 01:38:59,332
Should have been me.

1375
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:06,539
Do you know where they took her?

1376
01:39:08,408 --> 01:39:11,377
Gary...

1377
01:39:11,379 --> 01:39:13,379
tell me.

1378
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:20,119
- Mm-mm.
- Tell me.

1379
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:23,089
I just need the truck...

1380
01:39:23,091 --> 01:39:25,624
to get <i>me someplace.</i>

1381
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:37,370
<i>I'm</i> gonna make trouble.

1382
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,612
Meet me outside.

1383
01:40:51,945 --> 01:40:55,147
$30.

1384
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:57,883
$30 each.

1385
01:41:21,476 --> 01:41:24,577
Hi. Hi.

1386
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:25,811
How you doing?

1387
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:30,483
You okay?

1388
01:41:30,485 --> 01:41:32,718
Huh?

1389
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,555
Tell me something.

1390
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:38,824
You like funny faces?

1391
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:16,161
<i>If anything happens to me,</i>

1392
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:18,697
you get your ass
out of the way, you hear?

1393
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:20,799
You take my truck and get out.

1394
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,235
- Yeah.
- <i>And go get Coleman.</i>

1395
01:42:23,237 --> 01:42:25,304
Yes, sir.

1396
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:28,807
Tell him to call Earl.

1397
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,296
Shit!

1398
01:42:50,298 --> 01:42:51,764
Oh, no!

1399
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:54,266
No, no, no, no...

1400
01:43:00,807 --> 01:43:02,741
- Don't move.
- <i>God damn it!</i>

1401
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:04,276
I'll kill you both if you move.

1402
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:05,878
Joe, listen to me. This...

1403
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,179
it ain't what it looks like, man.

1404
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:08,714
I'm telling you.

1405
01:43:08,716 --> 01:43:11,917
- Dorothy! Dorothy!
- Get her out, Gary.

1406
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:15,721
Take your sister and go. Go! Go!

1407
01:43:15,723 --> 01:43:20,159
You. I don't know you.
Run, before I shoot you.

1408
01:43:20,161 --> 01:43:23,028
No, no, no, no!

1409
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,331
Joe, listen to me.
Just listen to me, okay?

1410
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:31,303
Gary! Gary!

1411
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:34,139
- <i>Gary!</i>
<i>- I'll get help, Joe!</i>

1412
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:38,677
Please.

1413
01:43:42,048 --> 01:43:46,285
God damn it. That girl, she...

1414
01:43:46,287 --> 01:43:48,354
<i>she don't know shit</i>
<i>about shit, man.</i>

1415
01:43:48,356 --> 01:43:50,756
She's just a piece of trash,
just like her daddy,

1416
01:43:50,758 --> 01:43:52,691
and she's gonna be
doing this shit in no time,

1417
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:54,727
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you, man.

1418
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:57,229
Look at the moon.

1419
01:44:17,717 --> 01:44:21,820
God damn it!

1420
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:25,924
<i>Oh, shit! Ah, fuck this shit!</i>

1421
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:30,763
If you want to shoot me,
go ahead and shoot me.

1422
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:32,865
I went through a windshield
and I don't give...

1423
01:45:51,277 --> 01:45:54,012
Are you my friend?

1424
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:50,996
What have you done, Joe?

1425
01:50:15,141 --> 01:50:17,142
<i>Here's what we do.</i>

1426
01:50:17,144 --> 01:50:19,378
<i>We start a little late,
around 8:00 in the morning,</i>

1427
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:21,546
<i>and we go till 4:00.</i>

1428
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:23,382
I pay by the week on Fridays.

1429
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:27,119
Some days we go long and we
run past 40 hours a week.

1430
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:29,121
I pay time and a half.

1431
01:50:29,123 --> 01:50:31,223
It's hard work.

1432
01:50:31,225 --> 01:50:33,325
I don't like a whole lot
of standing around.

1433
01:50:33,327 --> 01:50:35,227
We'll probably bust our ass

1434
01:50:35,229 --> 01:50:37,496
and get this spread out
by the end of April,

1435
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:40,032
get out all
the bare root seedlings,

1436
01:50:40,034 --> 01:50:41,366
and sometimes we stake 'em

1437
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:43,335
if we gotta keep
the little ones stable.

1438
01:50:43,337 --> 01:50:45,203
Most of the time,
we don't need to mess

1439
01:50:45,205 --> 01:50:48,140
with them little piney
seedlings like that.

1440
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,509
I'm gonna have you join
Donnell and his crew

1441
01:50:50,511 --> 01:50:53,045
on the west end of the farm.

1442
01:50:53,047 --> 01:50:55,180
Then, if everything goes
good on that acreage,

1443
01:50:55,182 --> 01:50:57,082
I'll have you help me supervise

1444
01:50:57,084 --> 01:50:59,551
the Monea project next summer.

1445
01:50:59,553 --> 01:51:03,355
Bastards can be hard
to work for sometimes.

1446
01:51:03,357 --> 01:51:05,590
But, hell, if you worked for Joe,

1447
01:51:05,592 --> 01:51:09,227
I think you'll do just fine.

1448
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:10,762
You got any questions?

1449
01:51:10,764 --> 01:51:12,531
No, sir. When can I start?

1450
01:51:12,533 --> 01:51:14,232
Right now if you're ready.

1451
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:17,769
Yes, sir.

1452
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:21,073
- So you knew Joe?
- Yeah, I sure did.

1453
01:51:21,075 --> 01:51:22,841
Joe was a good man.

1454
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:25,677
Good man to me, anyways.

1455
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,547
He was a good man to me, too.

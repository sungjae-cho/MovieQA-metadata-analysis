1
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
Good morning. Oh.

2
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:23,165
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

3
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:28,126
Hello. Hi.
I'm across the street.

4
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:32,758
Who? No. No, no. There's nothing
wrong with the ad layouts.

5
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,471
I checked them myself.

6
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,348
No, no. Marjorie just must've
gotten the months wrong again.

7
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:42,479
Yeah. Well, have you
talked to Laslo yet?

8
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,479
I don't care if he's upset.

9
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:47,484
Call Peter back and tell him
the layout has got to be four pages.

10
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:50,190
Not seven, not six, not five. Four.

11
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,201
- After...
- Hey, Robin.

12
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,204
Well, that's because
we changed photographers.

13
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,824
You must be kidding.
I... I double-checked everything.

14
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,334
- What's wrong with the ad layouts?
- What's wrong with the ad layouts, Leo?

15
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:03,293
I'll tell you what's wrong.
Practically everything.

16
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:06,386
- Because they're the wrong ad layouts.
- Marjorie, I... I have no idea...

17
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:10,178
Now, why am I standing here looking
at 30 pages of wrong layouts, Leo?

18
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:13,054
I'll tell you why.
Because someone...

19
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:15,892
Leo... didn't do their job!

20
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:19,023
Okay, the copy on the cover reads:

21
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:22,318
"Office Love Affairs...
How To Get Him And Your Raise."

22
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:24,314
- Good.
- Yeah?

23
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:28,452
Okay, look at me.
Come in a little closer.

24
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:33,039
Okay, right here. Great.
Good, I think we got it.

25
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,374
Carry on. Papaya diet?

26
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,703
Big problem. They're talking
about changing the fruit.

27
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:39,713
- What kind of fruit
are we talking about?
- I don't know.

28
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:41,715
- They said kiwi or something.
- I don't like kiwi.

29
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,417
These came for you.
They're from Frank.

30
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:48,304
My goodness. He is so sweet.
He was in London.

31
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,471
- Very exotic and expensive.
- Ohh.

32
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,476
"Can't wait to see you.
It's felt like an eternity."

33
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,565
- How long has he been gone?
- Two days.

34
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,728
- Two days?
- Yes.

35
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:01,354
"Meet me here at 7:30."
Ooh, good choice.

36
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:04,692
"Bring doll."

37
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:08,072
Doll. He does this kind
of thing all the time.

38
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:20,964
Hula dolls.
Polynesian restaurant.

39
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:22,969
Now just what are you up to?

40
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,257
- It's all part of the surprise.
- Thank you.

41
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:27,598
- Thanks. Uh-huh.
- Surprise?

42
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:30,850
Surp... You're not breaking up
with me, are you?

43
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:33,519
- No.
- Okay. You sure?

44
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:36,855
Because 69% of all relationships
break up in restaurants.

45
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,863
- We're not breaking up.
- Okay.

46
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:42,110
In fact, I want to increase
the romance in our lives.

47
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:46,112
- Oh, you do?
- Uh-huh. First, close your eyes.

48
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,123
- Now?
- Close 'em.

49
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,125
- Okay.
- All right.

50
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:52,247
Now, remember all the times
that you said we never go anywhere...

51
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:54,248
- And we're always working...
- Uh-huh. Right.

52
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,250
- And we never have any fun?
- Well, yeah.

53
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:59,879
Well, open your eyes
and look where I'm taking you.

54
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,137
- Oh.
- Come on.

55
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:09,638
- Oh, you're kidding!
- You and me in two weeks.

56
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,438
- In two weeks? I can't.
- Oh, oh, you can.

57
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:14,437
- I can?
- Uh-huh. I cleared it with Marjorie.

58
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,855
You did? Oh, you're a sneak.

59
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,824
Yeah. Six days and seven nights
on the secluded...

60
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,323
tropical island paradise
of Makatea.

61
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:51,026
Yeah. Yeah.
We arrived 15 minutes late.

62
00:04:51,154 --> 00:04:53,028
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, no. That's fine.

63
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:55,613
Uh, I'll tell you what.
Why don't I go find the bags...

64
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:58,198
and you... you get to go find
the charter, okay?

65
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,197
- I do? All right. Okay.
- Yeah. I'll see you in a few minutes.

66
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,207
- Sweetie?
- Huh?

67
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:05,499
- Love you.
- Love you.

68
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,238
- Uh, excuse me.
- Aah! Son of a bitch!

69
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:35,735
Miserable piece of rat shit.

70
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:40,621
Could you help me?
I'm looking for Tropical Charters.

71
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,291
- You goin' to Makatea?
- Yes.

72
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:50,423
Well, we'll be ready
in ten... twenty minutes.

73
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:01,636
But this...
this isn't the plane.

74
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:04,607
- What?
- The plane.

75
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:06,604
Where... Where's its mommy?

76
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:10,742
Oh. Tropical's plane
is laid up in Fiji.

77
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:15,073
We're filling in.
You're in luck. I'm your pilot.

78
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:16,956
Oh.

79
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,375
No. I ca... Uh, no. I, um...

80
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:22,960
I can't go in this.
It's, uh... It's broken.

81
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,842
No, it's not broken.
It's being maintained.

82
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,044
- This is my plane.
- Uh-huh.

83
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,053
This is a De Haviland Beaver.

84
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,934
This is one of the safest,
most reliable planes ever built.

85
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,303
Sweetie, is there a problem?

86
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:41,640
Uh, yes. He, um... He seems to think
we're gonna go in this old thing.

87
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:45,686
- What?
- Uh, I-I think... I think
we could find another charter.

88
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,982
- Don't you?
- Won't find one.

89
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:52,994
There's a boat leaves from the port.
Takes three days.

90
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,158
- Honey. Frank, honey, honey.
- All right. All right.

91
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,371
Uh, sweetie, I'm sure
the plane is perfectly safe...

92
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:02,882
and I'm sure the pilot
is a trained professional.

93
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:06,261
- He is the pilot.
- He...

94
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,722
Well, if you're going,
it'll be 20, 30 minutes.

95
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,009
I gotta get some oil.

96
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,850
- Oil? He's gonna get some oil now.
- You're gonna need help
with this luggage.

97
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,897
- No, thanks.
- No, we're good.

98
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:22,354
All right.
Everybody tied down?

99
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,487
Listen.
Are these really necessary?

100
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:26,568
Only if we crash.

101
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:33,868
- Hi.
- Everybody, this is Angelica,
our flight service director.

102
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:36,042
Hello.

103
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,337
Thank you. Hi.

104
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,085
- Sorry. Excuse me. Oh!
- Ohh.

105
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,793
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

106
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,053
- Oh!
- Hi, baby.

107
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:48,549
Mmm, hello.
Are you guys going to Makatea?

108
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:51,473
- We hope.
- Oh, you'll love it.
Are you from the States?

109
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,358
- Yes.
- I lived there for a while too.
It's very fun.

110
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:57,645
Hey, Quinn, look.
Look what I got. Check it out.

111
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,733
- What's that, baby?
- It's a bathing suit, silly.

112
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:04,026
I thought it was an eye patch.

113
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,629
Welcome to Makatea.

114
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:59,420
Here we are.
Thanks for flying Harris Freight...

115
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:02,849
where frequent flyers earn bonus points
good for valuable merchandise.

116
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,431
Hey, you're not trying
to steal my vest, are you?

117
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,823
- Mr Martin, Miss Monroe?
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,987
- Welcome to Hanaiti.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

119
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,364
- I'm Phillippe St. Clair,
the general manager.
- Hi.

120
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,653
Uh, can we have the reservation
for Mr Martin?

121
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:31,086
Oh! Oh, this is beautiful.

122
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:32,960
Wow.

123
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,963
Wow.

124
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:41,181
Okay. All right,
we're never leaving.

125
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:43,179
Yes.

126
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:48,979
I want this to be the most
unforgettable vacation of our lives.

127
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,115
- Having a good time?
- Oh, honey, I'm having a great time.

128
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,919
- Hey, you know what today is?
- What?

129
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:07,461
- It's our anniversary.
- We have an anniversary?

130
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,630
Yeah, unofficially.

131
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,382
- Oh.
- Three years ago today, we first met.

132
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,635
- Today? Today?
- Today. You don't remember?
We fought over a cab.

133
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,638
- Oh, I called you a jerk. Yes. Yes.
- Yeah. Oh, great. That you remember.

134
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:23,555
- Sorry.
- Yeah. See? But that's okay.
It was all part of love's odyssey.

135
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,934
- Odyssey?
- Mm-hmm.

136
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:31,234
If I asked, would you wear
something special for me tonight?

137
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:35,329
- What did you have in mind?
- This.

138
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,037
Will you marry me?

139
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:03,644
The Calypsonians
were all gathered together

140
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:07,064
Singing such a mournful tune

141
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:11,320
I don't know
if it was in the summertime

142
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:14,122
It could be the month of May or June

143
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,618
- Believe me, baby, I know the best
- I'll be back in a sec, okay?

144
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:23,586
- All right.
- When I find myself
I poke out my chest, oh

145
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:27,424
Over loving
Over, over, over

146
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,968
Over loving you

147
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:50,282
I always thought
this was a beautiful island...

148
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:54,321
but with you here,
it is even more beautiful.

149
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:57,621
- Oh!
- How long have you been on Makatea?

150
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:02,007
- Oh, you're kidding, right?
- No.

151
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,510
Well, you brought me here.

152
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:08,135
Today? Five hours ago?

153
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:12,222
Oh, I'm so...
So much has happened since...

154
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:14,513
Oh! Oops. Oopsy.

155
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:17,353
Wow. Here you go. What's...

156
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,359
- I slipped.
- Yeah.

157
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,859
So, where's your, uh, copilot?

158
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:24,903
Oh, she's busy with the tourists.

159
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,193
Well, that sounds like
you don't like us.

160
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,494
Oh, no. Never bite the hand
that-that feeds...

161
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,909
uh, your mouth, whatever.

162
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:39,253
Besides, you know, they're...
they're good for a laugh.

163
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,967
- You're a big laugher, are you?
- Oh, yeah.

164
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,173
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:49,478
They come here
looking for the magic...

166
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,724
expecting to find romance...

167
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,064
when they can't find it
any other place.

168
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,438
Maybe they will.

169
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:01,946
It's an island, babe.

170
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:06,241
If you don't bring it here,
you won't find it here.

171
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:10,910
Oh, heavy. Pilot and philosopher.

172
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:16,750
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Hey, I'm here with somebody.

173
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:19,554
You remember him?
He came in with me.

174
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:25,098
- I meant both of you.
- No, you didn't.

175
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:29,014
You're from New York, aren't you?

176
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:31,271
Hey, is everything okay?

177
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:34,276
- Oh, hi. Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

178
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:37,156
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Oh, that's very, uh...

179
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:40,200
- Let's go.
- Oh, but we're leaving, and so...

180
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,200
Well, maybe some other time...

181
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:44,203
- Ta-ta.
- I'll buy you a drink.

182
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:48,199
- Okay, bye.
- Was he bothering you?

183
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:50,543
- Oh, no. He was just a little...
- Was he hitting on you?

184
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,878
From over there,
it looked like he was hitting on you.

185
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,882
- Maybe a little.
- He was?

186
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,548
- Do you want me to do
something about it?
- Like what?

187
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,432
Hey, I don't go to the gym every day
just to watch old guys shower.

188
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:02,308
- You know, I will...
- Really?

189
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:04,303
- Yeah.
- Really?

190
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,899
Well done, ocean.

191
00:14:12,364 --> 00:14:14,321
Well done, sky.

192
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,357
Well done, maitais.

193
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:21,079
- Well done, silicone. Oh, my.
- Hey!

194
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:26,330
Hey, I'm, I'm getting
a little toasty here.

195
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,496
You want me to put
some cream on you, honey?

196
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,172
You'd do that for me?
You... You'd cream me up?

197
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:35,304
Only for you. Where is it?

198
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:38,141
Excuse me. Miss Monroe?
You have a phone call.

199
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,633
- I do?
- You could take it at the bar.

200
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:43,054
What... Who would be
calling you here?

201
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,859
I have no idea.
I'll be right back.

202
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,193
- Can I get two maitais, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

203
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,399
Thank you. Hello?

204
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,408
Look, I know you're on vacation...

205
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,825
but this is a dire emergency.

206
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,954
- Oh, no.
- The photo shoot's on...

207
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,206
but it's an availability nightmare.

208
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:06,333
Vendela and Evander Holyfield
only have a mutual 17-hour window.

209
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,499
If we don't get them now,
nobody's available...

210
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:10,716
for four months and
we lose them for the May cover.

211
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:13,550
Well, there's gotta be somebody closer
whose life you can screw up.

212
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,130
That's the ironic thing, dear.
There's not.

213
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:19,637
Vendela's in Sydney.
Evander's in Osaka.

214
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:22,227
I threw Taylor on a plane
this morning to Papeete.

215
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:25,477
- Tahiti?
- Yes. They're all coming to you.

216
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,316
All you have to do
is fly back to Tahiti...

217
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:30,275
baby-sit the shoot,
fly back out.

218
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:33,908
- Fifteen hours at the most.
- Look, this is complicated.

219
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:37,245
Uh, Frank proposed
to me last night.

220
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:39,289
Oh, my God!

221
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,040
This is so exciting.
Sweetie, I'm so happy for you.

222
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,206
Well, I'm glad, but...

223
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,542
The point is, what kind of message
am I sending to Frank...

224
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:50,466
if the day after our betrothal, I'm
leaving him to go on some photo shoot?

225
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,809
An excellent message.

226
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:59,935
This is the perfect opportunity
to establish parameters.

227
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,100
- Oh, God.
- I read somewhere...

228
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:04,608
that 38.6% of all women...

229
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:09,075
are pressured into quitting their jobs
in the first year of marriage.

230
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,493
Marjorie, you read that
in our magazine, and we made it up.

231
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:17,119
Oh, Please, Robin, please.
Please, please, Robin, please?

232
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,626
- Deal.
- Oh, good!

233
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:24,214
- Do you have a way back to Tahiti?
- Oh, yeah, I can...

234
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:31,134
- That's good? Yeah?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

235
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:35,018
Thanks.

236
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,109
Don't move a muscle.
Lay down. Stay. Yeah.

237
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:51,366
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

238
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:54,500
- Uh, I'm looking for...
- Quinny, it's for you.

239
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:57,456
Okay. Hi there.

240
00:16:57,547 --> 00:17:01,130
- Ohh.
- Hi. I'm really sorry to interrupt you.

241
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:04,005
I-I sort of have an emergency.

242
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:06,670
Emergency? What's going on?

243
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:10,846
Well, my boss called me, and she
wants me to go to Tahiti tonight.

244
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:14,893
Oh, well, I'm sort of
on my layover here.

245
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:19,189
Right. Uh, would $500
cut your layover short?

246
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,026
Um, baby, want to go to Papeete?

247
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:27,203
I can't. I have a show tonight.
Tuesday is tamure night.

248
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,661
- Uh, it's tamure night.
- Oh.

249
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,869
My hands are tied.
That's for later.

250
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,330
You know, I'm stuck.
I-I-I really...

251
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,959
This is really important.
You'd be doing me a tremendous favour.

252
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:44,840
- How would 700 be?
- Okay.

253
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:45,928
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

254
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,263
- Great.
- I'll meet you at the plane in...

255
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:51,888
- Give me an hour.
- Great. Thank you.

256
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:55,683
Honey, it's a known fact
that 38.6% of all women...

257
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:59,230
are pressured into quitting their jobs
the first year of marriage.

258
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:02,907
That was in your magazine.
You probably made it up.

259
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,909
If you had to work,
I would understand.

260
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:14,250
That's because you're not
as romantic as I am.

261
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:19,717
Ohh. So, come with me.

262
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,682
- No.
- How come?

263
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,764
Because if I go with you,
I'll resent the fact that I'm there.

264
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:31,025
If I stay here, I'll miss you, but
you'll feel guilty. I like that better.

265
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,936
Come on.
It's only for one night, hubby.

266
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,946
- Say that again.
- What, hubby?

267
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:45,165
- I like that. Say it.
- Hubby.

268
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:54,880
- Ready to go.
- Is it safe to fly?

269
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:58,215
- It is with me.
- Oh, you're that good, huh?

270
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,721
I'm the best you've ever been with.

271
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:03,389
I'm not sure
I trust your equipment.

272
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,272
We may be old, but we're sturdy.

273
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,765
Mm-hmm. What's all this?

274
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,479
Hotel overstocks, local trinkets.
I was gonna fly 'em to Tahiti tomorrow.

275
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:15,152
But with your job,
I got a twofer.

276
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,490
Oh, how handy for you.

277
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:22,330
Excuse me. I just want to keep this
from flying at you.

278
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:26,208
There we go.
Do you have my, uh, money?

279
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:29,007
Oh. Yes.

280
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:31,498
- Thank you.
- It's all there.

281
00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:33,503
I trust you.

282
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:14,384
So what kind of work do you do,
uh, back there in New York?

283
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm an assistant editor
for a magazine called Dazzle.

284
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,848
- Dazzle?
- Yeah.

285
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,849
Never heard of that one.

286
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:25,690
Well, you're not exactly
the demographic we shoot for.

287
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,235
Uh, this is it.

288
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,075
"Dazzle."

289
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:36,325
"Your Derriere: Five Exercises
to Tame the Beast."

290
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:39,079
"Ten Ways to Light His Fire."

291
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:44,665
For Pete's sake.
"Ten Ways to Light His Fire."

292
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,961
You know how a woman
gets a man excited?

293
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:51,422
- How?
- She shows up.

294
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:54,131
That's it. We're guys.
We're easy.

295
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:57,888
Of course, for that you can't charge
six bucks an issue, can you?

296
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,397
Now, does that advice
come with the $700...

297
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:03,608
or do I need to pay extra for that?

298
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:06,775
- It's on the house.
- Thanks.

299
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:34,210
Um, island flight watch,
Beaver 0318.

300
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:38,545
We are at 3,500
on a heading of, uh, 1-1-0.

301
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:43,049
I'm looking for a weather update,
please, uh, along our route of flight.

302
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:46,302
Thirty-six Victor, be advised...

303
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:52,684
...southwestern...
- Say again.

304
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:04,910
I'm sorry. This weather came up
quicker than anybody anticipated.

305
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:10,081
We're gonna have to turn back
to Makatea.

306
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:14,250
- It's just not worth the risk.
- Uh, all right.

307
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:33,404
A line of squalls
has got us boxed in.

308
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:36,194
Tighten up your seat belt.
It's gonna get bumpy.

309
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:39,279
Wha... Uh.

310
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,747
Y-You don't-don't mind
if I just come sit up here with you?

311
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:48,454
Get your seat belt on.

312
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,968
- What are those?
- Uh, Xanax.

313
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:03,142
My doctor prescribed them
for situations of tension.

314
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:05,348
- I think this qualifies.
- Give me a couple.

315
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,356
You just drive.

316
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,180
- What are you taking now?
- Xanax.

317
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:45,061
My doctor prescribed them
for situations of "sension."

318
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:47,067
Give me those.

319
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:58,704
Whoo! Hey,
that was close, huh? Whoo!

320
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:04,708
That was more than close.
That hit us.

321
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,289
- Oh, no.
- Shit. It fried the radios.

322
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:09,834
Oh, no. That's bad, huh?

323
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:16,757
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

324
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:20,893
Beaver 0318.
Unable to maintain altitude.

325
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:23,148
Can anybody hear this?

326
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:28,526
- Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.
- Attention, KMart shoppers!

327
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:31,404
Snow shovels are on sale for $12.99.

328
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:34,952
Put that down.
I'm unable to maintain altitude.

329
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:38,083
Forty miles south-southeast of Makatea.

330
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:42,922
Mayday, mayday, mayday

331
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,092
How many of those things
did you take?

332
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:50,472
Um, you know, I just don't know.

333
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,880
- Look.
- What?

334
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:54,764
We're in trouble here.
I want you to sit back...

335
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:59,765
be quiet, keep your seat belt tight
and let me fly this thing.

336
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:03,437
Yes, sir.

337
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:17,995
There's an island down there.

338
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,917
I can see a beach.

339
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:24,927
- I'm gonna set us down.
- Okeydokey.

340
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:02,881
- Rock on the beach!
There's a rock on the beach!
- Son of a bitch!

341
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,119
Good morning.

342
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:06,950
Could you get me a cup of coffee?

343
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,585
Sure, I'll get right on it, ma'am.

344
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:13,253
Oh, God, whe...

345
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:17,131
- Where are we?
- Here.

346
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,180
Where? Where?

347
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:22,764
Somewhere between Makatea and Tahiti.

348
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:26,264
That's... That's the best
I can do for you.

349
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:31,312
Whoa! What happened?

350
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:34,565
It crumpled the landing gear
when we hit.

351
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:36,946
Well, aren't you gonna fix it?

352
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:39,656
I mean, can't we...
can't we reattach it somehow?

353
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:43,122
Oh, sure. We'll, like,
glue it back on.

354
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,995
- How's that?
- Aren't you one of those guys?

355
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,123
What guys?

356
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:52,085
Those guy guys.
You know, those guys with skills.

357
00:28:52,176 --> 00:28:54,798
- Skills?
- Yeah.

358
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:57,214
You send them out into the wilderness
with a pocketknife and a Q-tip...

359
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,054
and they build you
a shopping mall.

360
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:04,480
- You can't do that?
- No. No, I can't do that.

361
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:08,184
But I can do this.
Does that help?

362
00:29:12,074 --> 00:29:14,113
I can get us out of here.

363
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:16,574
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

364
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:20,074
Hey. Right? Huh?

365
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,542
Phone, huh?
I'm gonna get us out of here.

366
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:27,122
Pronto.

367
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:31,843
Right. Come on, phone.

368
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,357
So, what are we,
like, shipwrecked?

369
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:49,362
- How do you want it?
- Excuse me?

370
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,991
Do you want it sugar-coated
or right between the eyes?

371
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:55,822
You pick.

372
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:02,543
We've only got one wheel,
so we can't take off.

373
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:07,049
Lightning fried the radio
and the emergency location transmitter.

374
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:10,546
Air-Sea will probably try a rescue,
but without a beacon to hone in...

375
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:13,765
it's like trying to find a flea
on an elephant's ass.

376
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:18,346
The only thing we've got is...

377
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,397
this flare gun and a single flare.

378
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,561
Is it too late
to get it sugar-coated?

379
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:25,776
That was sugar-coated.

380
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,409
Well, then, what's the bad news?

381
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,330
The bad news is
we may be here for a long time.

382
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:46,094
You and me.
For a long, long...

383
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:52,099
long, long, long, long time.

384
00:30:57,191 --> 00:31:00,275
Well, I want my $700 back.

385
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:05,400
- What?
- You heard me. My $700. I want it back.

386
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:08,778
You said you were gonna take me
to Tahiti. You didn't.

387
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,248
Give it back. Come on.

388
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:23,425
One, two, three...

389
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:29,260
- Wha...
- I figure I got you halfway.

390
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:32,388
Halfway? Halfway?

391
00:31:32,522 --> 00:31:34,396
- Halfway.
- Halfway? Whoo!

392
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:37,478
Halfway? Oh, boy, you're good!

393
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:41,479
Whoo! You got me halfway!
That's fantastic!

394
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:44,651
Wha... What are you doing?
Hey! Hey! Get away from my plane!

395
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:46,659
- Oh, you be quiet.
- Goddam it! Get outta there!

396
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:48,780
- I'm gonna do something!
- Hey! Leave that stuff alone!

397
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,831
- You shut up!
- Come on out! Get outta there!

398
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:54,495
What do you think you're doing?
Leave my stuff a... Hey, hey, come on!

399
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:58,004
What's this?
It's a boat.

400
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:01,219
- It's a life raft.
- We can use that to get off the island.

401
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:03,339
Where are you gonna go?
You don't even know where you are.

402
00:32:03,432 --> 00:32:05,804
Last thing you wanna do
is go bouncing around the ocean...

403
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:08,929
in an eight-foot blowup boat.

404
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:11,814
- Don't tell me what I want!
- Give that... Give it!

405
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:15,399
Hey, don't pull on that!
Leave it alone! Hey, hey!

406
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:19,989
Oh! Oh! Get... Wait! Wait!
Get me out! No! Oh!

407
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,035
Quinn!

408
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,504
Quinn!

409
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:38,380
Get me out of here!

410
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:41,383
Get me... Get me out of here!

411
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:51,064
Are you gonna stop acting
like a lunatic?

412
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:54,811
- Fuck you!
- Pardon me? What'd you say?

413
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:06,875
- That's what I thought you said.
- Quinn.

414
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,254
Yeah.

415
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:15,178
Mr Martin? There's
a telephone call for Miss Monroe.

416
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:17,426
Oh. I'll take it.

417
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:19,637
Hello? Hello?

418
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:22,637
We... This is Frank Martin.
Who is...

419
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,269
Oh, hi, Marjorie.
It's Frank.

420
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:29,144
No, she... she left yesterday.

421
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:32,605
What?

422
00:33:32,697 --> 00:33:34,856
Mary, it's Phillippe
at Makatea.

423
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:37,614
Uh, Quinn flew a lady
back to you last night.

424
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:41,280
Can you look if the De Haviland
is at the gate? No, I'll wait.

425
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:44,120
I ran into Tony. He said
that Quinny didn't make Tahiti.

426
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:46,162
Hold on, Angelica.
We don't know anything yet.

427
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:48,289
Yes, Mary, right here.

428
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,093
Get Air-Sea Rescue, Mary.
Call me back.

429
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,090
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

430
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:03,977
Come on. You wanna drink water,
you gotta haul water. Let's go.

431
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:13,316
- What are you lookin' at?
- Nothing.

432
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,076
- Something.
- Nothing.

433
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:17,326
Oh, don't give me that.
You were ogling.

434
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:18,825
- Ogling?
- Yeah.

435
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,621
- Ogling? Let me ask you something.
- What?

436
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:24,166
When you go into the store
to buy something like that,
what do you say to the clerk?

437
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:26,704
"Give me that outfit
so nobody'll look at me"?

438
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:30,341
No, I like people looking.
Just not you.

439
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:39,637
If it makes you feel any better,
you're not my type.

440
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,768
- Oh, good. Why?
- Why?

441
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:46,068
Yeah. You know,
I'm making conversation. Why?

442
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:52,907
You talk too much.
You're opinionated.

443
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:57,367
You're stubborn,
sarcastic and stuck-up.

444
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:00,625
Your ass is too narrow,
and your tits are too small.

445
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:06,542
Hey, you wanna know why
you're not my type?

446
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:08,545
Nope.

447
00:35:18,774 --> 00:35:20,317
- I'm American.
- Oh, thank God.

448
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:22,482
- Tom Morrow. I'll take you up.
- Frank. Listen, so how do we find them?

449
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:25,103
Well, we're gonna fly over the water
and look out the window.

450
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,113
Wh... Whoa-Whoa-Whoa-Whoa.
That's it?

451
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:29,318
What about the, uh,
the modern technology?

452
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:31,327
Don't you have, like,
satellites, lasers...

453
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:33,910
- Mr Martin, take a seat.
- Heat-seeking kind of...

454
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,158
- Hey, I'm Ricky.
- Good. Great. I'm Frank.

455
00:35:36,294 --> 00:35:39,248
- Listen, money is no object, all right?
- Yeah. Just get in.

456
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:44,461
Try breathing very deeply.
I find that helpful.

457
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:49,215
If they went into the water,
it's only been 12 hours.

458
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:52,095
- There's a good chance we'll find them.
- Okay.

459
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:15,951
Hey, Bwana, why don't you
let me lead for a while?

460
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:20,543
Okay. This'll be interesting.

461
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:38,484
Now there. You see?
I found it.

462
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,910
Come on, Quinny.

463
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,497
Oh, my God.

464
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,339
Oh, it's beautiful.

465
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:08,685
Quinn, this is...
Whoa! Whoa!

466
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:12,521
Wha... Who... Wait! Oh, God!

467
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:15,273
- Hey! Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey, hold on!
- Whoa!

468
00:37:15,404 --> 00:37:18,191
- What are you doin'?
- What the hell's that?

469
00:37:18,282 --> 00:37:20,440
It's a pig.
What are you worried about?

470
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:23,364
He's more afraid of us than we...
Watch! Watch!

471
00:37:23,455 --> 00:37:25,697
Hah! Go on! Go on!

472
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:28,745
- Go on! Get outta here! Go on!
- Hyah! Hyah!

473
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:31,913
- Ohh!
- Bye-bye! Come on!

474
00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:36,046
- Come on!
- Hey, Quinn?

475
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:38,294
Huh? What?

476
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,636
What?

477
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:45,891
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but, uh,
I'm having a bit of a problem.

478
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:50,601
What's the problem?

479
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:54,898
Some sort of creature
has just swum up my pants.

480
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:00,574
I'm guessing... I'm guessing a snake.

481
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:06,542
Oh. That's bad.

482
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:11,130
So, uh, what do I do?

483
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:14,592
I mean, I could reach down
and, and grab it.

484
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:19,258
No, that... that could be risky.
It might be poisonous.

485
00:38:20,518 --> 00:38:23,604
Well, right. But on the other hand,
if it's poisonous and will bite me...

486
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,431
do I want to allow it to continue
to swim around in my shorts?

487
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:30,604
- All good questions.
- Would you just give me some advice?

488
00:38:30,696 --> 00:38:33,318
All right? Just advice, input, anything.
Just give it to me.

489
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:36,736
I'm very open at this particular
juncture, all right?

490
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:38,737
- Just stand still.
- Still.

491
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,368
- Stand still.
- Right. Yeah.

492
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,457
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

493
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:45,453
All right.

494
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:51,508
Oh, God.

495
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:54,054
- No.
- What?

496
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,968
- Not good.
- What? Wha...

497
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:00,226
Shhh. I'm trying to concentrate here.

498
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:02,726
Okay. Okay.

499
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:05,183
All right, let's see.

500
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,333
Better not catch you smiling.

501
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:26,670
Oh, God. Oh, God!

502
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:40,515
- Thanks.
- Well, I'm not without skills.

503
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:30,781
Oh. You're going on a date?

504
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:34,999
- Do you like it?
- Why the fashion statement?

505
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:37,914
- Goin' hunting.
- Oh. For what?

506
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:45,169
No! You wouldn't!

507
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:47,428
They are magnificent creatures!

508
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:50,267
And I hear they taste
just like chicken.

509
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:52,268
Chicken.

510
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:17,128
Maybe I should have a taste.

511
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:19,629
You know, just in case somebody asks me
someday, "Have you ever had peacock"...

512
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:22,547
I can say, "Yes, I have."

513
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:26,178
You won't regret it.

514
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:29,145
Okay. Perfect.

515
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:33,973
Whoa! Ah.

516
00:41:41,243 --> 00:41:45,026
Oh. Oh, my God!

517
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:48,912
Mmm. Mmm. Wow.

518
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:54,002
Chicken. Okay, chicken.

519
00:41:57,802 --> 00:42:01,670
- Have you always been a pilot?
- All my grown-up life.

520
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:04,600
- Like doing what?
- All kinds of flying.

521
00:42:04,726 --> 00:42:07,847
- Mm-hmm.
- I had my own very successful business.

522
00:42:09,064 --> 00:42:10,938
What happened?

523
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:17,023
I found a better way of life,
that's all.

524
00:42:18,116 --> 00:42:21,034
- Like what?
- Came out here...

525
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:24,163
got a nice little house
on a beautiful beach.

526
00:42:24,248 --> 00:42:26,740
- Mm-hmm.
- Got my plane.

527
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:29,995
Uh-oh. Hmm.

528
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:35,877
I'm doing what I wanna do.
Got peace and quiet.

529
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,764
Living the life
every man dreams of.

530
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,463
Well, yeah, until they're 12.

531
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,442
I'm sorry.
That was out of line.

532
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,687
- No.
- I'm just...

533
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,780
I'm just cranky, you know,
from being shipwrecked.

534
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:18,090
Look at that sky. You don't see
a sky like that in New York City.

535
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:20,223
No, that's a good sky.

536
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:25,017
- Whoa.
- All right. Sorry. I'm...

537
00:43:26,526 --> 00:43:29,361
I'm just a little tipsy.
That's...

538
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:36,111
Good night.

539
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,663
Good night.

540
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,000
Suave.

541
00:43:52,137 --> 00:43:54,011
Really suave.

542
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,242
Oh.

543
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:25,663
Oh, my God. It's a plane. Oh!

544
00:44:26,926 --> 00:44:30,178
Oh, it's a plane. What do we, uh...

545
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:33,799
Flare! We need the flare!
Uh, Quinn?

546
00:44:33,893 --> 00:44:39,517
Quinn, uh, get up!
There's a plane! We need...

547
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:42,603
Oh, God! Quinn, we need...

548
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:48,359
Okay. Oh. Oh!

549
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,360
Careful.

550
00:44:52,246 --> 00:44:54,785
Flare! Jesus!

551
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:04,007
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, no.

552
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:11,642
Uh-oh. Oh, boy.

553
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:15,469
Oh! Oh, no.

554
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:19,902
Oh, uh-oh. Oh, no.

555
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:22,067
- Wha...
- Oh, nuts.

556
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:33,407
What... Oh!

557
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:36,537
What the hell did you do?
What the... You...

558
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:41,257
You wasted our only goddam flare
to shoot a goddam palm tree?

559
00:45:41,343 --> 00:45:44,095
I wouldn't have shot the goddam tree
if you hadn't rolled into me.

560
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,465
I was trying to signal
the goddam plane!

561
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,758
Wha... What goddam plane?

562
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:52,605
That goddam plane.

563
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,935
- That goddam plane?
- Yeah.

564
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,897
That's a commercial airliner.

565
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,824
It's five miles high,
going 600 miles an hour!

566
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:07,446
They wouldn't see a nuclear explosion
if they were looking for it
much less a flare!

567
00:46:07,538 --> 00:46:09,448
How the hell was I
supposed to know that?

568
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:12,292
If you hadn't drunken yourself into
a coma, maybe you could've told me that!

569
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:14,037
- Do you know what you've done?
- What?

570
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,547
- Do you know what you've done?
- What?

571
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:19,124
You've taken our one good chance
of being found and pissed it away!

572
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,502
Don't you dare blame this on me!
If you were half a pilot...

573
00:46:21,637 --> 00:46:23,796
we wouldn't be on this island!

574
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,847
I am the best goddam pilot
you're ever gonna meet!

575
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:30,057
Huh! I've flown with you twice.
You've crashed half the time!

576
00:46:31,606 --> 00:46:35,557
And there is nothing
wrong with my tits!

577
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:55,880
- There's so much water.
- Don't worry.

578
00:46:56,009 --> 00:47:01,431
Wherever they are, Quinny is going
to take good care of your girlfriend.

579
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:03,432
What do you mean by that?

580
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:08,638
Come on, let's pick up
the pace a little.

581
00:47:08,732 --> 00:47:11,224
I want to get to the top
before dark.

582
00:47:36,305 --> 00:47:38,214
Goddam.

583
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,389
I've had just about as much
vacation as I can stand.

584
00:47:55,284 --> 00:47:57,905
Whoo! Whoo! God!

585
00:47:58,037 --> 00:48:00,077
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- What stop? What? Stop.

586
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:01,575
- Stop!
- What?

587
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,574
- Stop.
- What?

588
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:09,758
What?

589
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:22,016
We better find the beacon.

590
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:28,228
This way.

591
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,947
That beacon better be up there.

592
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,283
Look, the storm blew us
southwest 40 minutes.

593
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,784
Good chance this is Tamitange.

594
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,412
Ah, Tamitange. Well,
that explains everything.

595
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:48,840
There's a radio navigation beacon
on the top of Tamitange.

596
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:52,587
We find it. We shut it down.
They come out and fix it. We're rescued.

597
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:58,098
It took 'em two years to fix
the streetlight outside my apartment.

598
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,980
Wow.

599
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,997
Oh, wow.

600
00:49:25,426 --> 00:49:27,502
Wow, this is beautiful. Well?

601
00:49:36,772 --> 00:49:39,098
So, where's the beacon?

602
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,528
Huh?

603
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:47,906
- Well...
- Oh, let me see.

604
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:52,862
Well, it's this one, right?
Tamitange, the one with the funny-shaped
peninsula to the north, right?

605
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,705
- Yeah.
- Well, tha... that's north, right?

606
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,702
- Right? Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

607
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:07,211
There's no peninsula.

608
00:50:07,348 --> 00:50:10,017
Who stole the peninsula?

609
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:16,556
- No.
- This isn't Tamitange?

610
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:25,022
So there is no beacon
that we're gonna turn off...

611
00:50:25,118 --> 00:50:28,072
and they're gonna come fix it
and find us?

612
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,953
Well, well, we could be, um...

613
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:41,924
We could be further to the south.
This could be Mata Nui.

614
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:48,556
And what's on Mata Nui?

615
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,098
Us.

616
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,280
What? What do I want...

617
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:04,277
What are you doing?

618
00:51:10,376 --> 00:51:12,998
Son of a bitch! Goddam it!

619
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:35,184
Uh, please don't do that again.

620
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,568
I just want one goddam thing
to go right.

621
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:42,986
Oh, God. I know. Come on.

622
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:47,534
Ever since we've been here,
you've been so confident.

623
00:51:47,668 --> 00:51:51,334
- You have all the answers.
- Well, I'm the captain.

624
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:55,669
That's my job. It's no good for me
to go waving my arms in the air...

625
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:58,678
and screaming,
"Oh, shit, we're gonna die."

626
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:02,013
That doesn't evoke
much confidence, does it?

627
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:04,472
No, no, that does not.

628
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:08,642
I need you to be
my confident captain.

629
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:15,197
I can't tell you how difficult
this is gonna be for me if you lose it.

630
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:22,620
Okay.

631
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,043
Okay.

632
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:32,336
- I'm all right now.
- Oh, good. Good.

633
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:41,723
Wait. Quinn.

634
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:44,344
What? What?

635
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:46,308
What do you need?
Hey. Come on. Get out of there.

636
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,436
- What do you want?
- Look, look, look, look.

637
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,479
Oh, yes.

638
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:54,692
It's a boat.

639
00:52:58,288 --> 00:52:59,913
Looks like they're puttin' in
to that cove.

640
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,124
Yeah, well, how do we signal 'em?

641
00:53:03,251 --> 00:53:05,375
- A flare would be nice.
- Don't start. Come on.

642
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:07,539
What do we do?
How do we get down there?

643
00:53:07,673 --> 00:53:09,465
Well, we go...

644
00:53:09,592 --> 00:53:11,467
- Down the mountain, up the mountain,
down the mountain.
- Yeah.

645
00:53:11,595 --> 00:53:13,339
- We get to our life raft...
- Uh-huh.

646
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:16,218
and hope they'll still be
there in the morning. Come on.

647
00:54:03,486 --> 00:54:05,146
Oh, God.

648
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:22,251
- Come on. I'll take over.
- Oh, God. Thanks.

649
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:29,421
So what's the deal
with you and, um...

650
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,851
- Angelica.
- Yeah.

651
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:38,974
No deal. We're friends.

652
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,737
She works at the hotel
a couple months a year.

653
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,646
We have some laughs.
Keep it simple.

654
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,404
Has it always been simple...

655
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,992
or has there ever been
anyone complicated?

656
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,160
That's a yes. Yes?

657
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,422
How complicated?
Scale from one to ten?

658
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:02,293
- Twelve.
- Twelve?

659
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:04,461
God. What happened?

660
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:10,058
Well, tragically,
she, uh, she...

661
00:55:10,184 --> 00:55:12,641
Died? Oh, my God.
I'm so, I'm so...

662
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,853
- No, she didn't die!
- Oh. Oh.

663
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:17,271
- You gonna let me tell the story,
or what?
- I'm sorry!

664
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,311
Sure. Tell it.

665
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:23,448
She, uh, fell in love
with somebody else.

666
00:55:23,575 --> 00:55:26,860
Not just somebody else.

667
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:30,703
My best friend. My partner.
The guy I was in business with.

668
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:33,121
God. What did you do?

669
00:55:33,252 --> 00:55:36,337
Well, I, uh, bowed out.
I gave 'em my blessing.

670
00:55:38,424 --> 00:55:40,583
Are they still together?

671
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,134
No. They broke up.

672
00:55:45,432 --> 00:55:48,303
- Not before I sold 'em
my half of the business.
- Uh-huh.

673
00:55:48,436 --> 00:55:51,557
Came out here. Got my plane.

674
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,395
Never looked back.
Best thing that ever happened to me.

675
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:58,733
- There are two boats.
- What? Two boats?

676
00:55:58,864 --> 00:56:00,738
Two boats!

677
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:04,239
Look.

678
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:07,828
God, this is great, huh?
Hello!

679
00:56:13,297 --> 00:56:15,171
Hello!

680
00:56:19,387 --> 00:56:21,594
- Sit down! We gotta get out of here!
- Why? Why?

681
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,721
- We gotta get out of here!
- What? Get out of here?

682
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:26,514
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit.
- What are you talking about?

683
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:29,101
Oh, my God!

684
00:56:32,401 --> 00:56:35,522
- Who... Who are they?
- Pirates!

685
00:56:35,656 --> 00:56:37,944
Pi... Pirates? As in, "argh"?

686
00:56:38,074 --> 00:56:40,447
Smugglers. Thieves.

687
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:43,157
They rob boats!

688
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:46,741
- Rob boats? They just killed a guy!
- They'll kill us too.

689
00:56:46,835 --> 00:56:50,334
- Just for bein' here!
Just for seein' 'em!
- Wha...

690
00:57:13,114 --> 00:57:15,984
- Shit, he just saw me.
- We got company.

691
00:57:22,207 --> 00:57:23,950
Ohh. Oh, no.

692
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:27,374
They just lowered a boat!

693
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:30,506
- What kind of a boat?
- A motorboat!

694
00:57:30,591 --> 00:57:32,501
Shit! Shit!

695
00:57:32,635 --> 00:57:34,178
Shit!

696
00:57:44,023 --> 00:57:45,850
Oh, God! Row faster!

697
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,364
Go! Go, go.

698
00:58:50,722 --> 00:58:53,261
I can't.

699
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:54,970
Yes, you can.

700
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:57,179
How'd he get over there?

701
00:59:07,574 --> 00:59:09,448
- Go.
- Where? What?

702
00:59:51,915 --> 00:59:53,825
Don't!

703
00:59:56,379 --> 00:59:59,131
Let's not make this difficult.

704
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:07,430
That was a very stupid thing to do.
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

705
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,635
- Say goodbye.
- We've got gold.

706
01:00:18,196 --> 01:00:20,104
Up.

707
01:00:21,949 --> 01:00:23,527
Gold?

708
01:00:24,618 --> 01:00:26,991
- Gold.
- Yeah, we've got gold.

709
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:31,370
I'm a jewellry designer.

710
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:34,705
I design jewellry with gold.
And precious stones.

711
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:39,626
- Precious stones, like, uh...
- I have sold to all the finest stores.

712
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,544
And, um, we've got display cases
on the... on the boat.

713
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,220
Because, uh, we're expanding
the business in the Far East.

714
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,062
But that's my husband's end
of the business.

715
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:52,516
- 'Cause I'm-I'm in marketing.
- Wiz! You're a wiz!

716
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:10,658
Take us to the boat.

717
01:01:34,906 --> 01:01:36,697
Hey!

718
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:13,906
Oh, my God! Now what?

719
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:18,446
We go on three.
One, two...

720
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:21,823
I can't!
You go. Save yourself.

721
01:02:25,796 --> 01:02:27,835
- I'm sorry.
- For kissing me?

722
01:02:27,964 --> 01:02:30,670
No. For this.

723
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,535
Damn!

724
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:57,031
Damn!

725
01:03:04,338 --> 01:03:06,296
You know how some people say...

726
01:03:06,424 --> 01:03:09,378
"You don't know what you had
until you lose it"?

727
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,637
It's a load of crap.

728
01:03:12,764 --> 01:03:14,674
I knew what I had.

729
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:20,178
God, I loved her.

730
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:22,350
Love her. Love her.

731
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:25,817
Not to insult you, but...

732
01:03:25,946 --> 01:03:28,235
I don't think men know
what love is.

733
01:03:28,324 --> 01:03:29,901
- I mean...
- I do.

734
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:31,148
- Yeah?
- I do!

735
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:33,824
Well, guys, they tell me
they love me all the time.

736
01:03:33,955 --> 01:03:36,410
Well, I'm sure at least
some of them mean it.

737
01:03:36,498 --> 01:03:38,408
No, they don't.

738
01:04:43,116 --> 01:04:44,657
Do you think they gave up?

739
01:04:44,742 --> 01:04:48,158
I don't know.
We shouldn't go back to the camp.

740
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:50,572
The plane's too easy to spot.

741
01:04:50,707 --> 01:04:52,997
I am so scared.

742
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:56,668
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm a little scared myself.

743
01:04:56,797 --> 01:05:00,001
No. No, that does not
make me feel better.

744
01:05:00,092 --> 01:05:02,549
- I thought that's what women wanted.
- What?

745
01:05:02,678 --> 01:05:05,134
Men who weren't afraid to cry...

746
01:05:05,223 --> 01:05:07,181
who are in touch
with their feminine side.

747
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:10,386
No, not when they're being chased by
pirates. They like 'em mean and armed.

748
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:32,997
Whoa.

749
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,836
This is not a good island
for aeroplanes.

750
01:05:38,928 --> 01:05:41,763
It's a Japanese World War II
float plane.

751
01:05:41,889 --> 01:05:44,297
It's been up there
for 50 years.

752
01:05:45,977 --> 01:05:47,685
Jesus.

753
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:50,393
You don't think there's
any way that you could...

754
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:52,854
Nah.

755
01:05:52,943 --> 01:05:55,695
This looks like a safe place
to spend the night.

756
01:05:58,323 --> 01:06:01,741
I'm gonna see if there's
anything I can use up there.

757
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:11,876
- Hi.
- Hey.

758
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:14,917
This is me here.

759
01:06:19,055 --> 01:06:21,427
We gotta meet them
at 6:00 a.m.

760
01:06:21,558 --> 01:06:23,634
They're gonna widen the search.

761
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:26,557
I may be too drunk
to wake up at 6:00 a.m.

762
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:28,640
I know how... how...

763
01:06:32,153 --> 01:06:35,439
Are you sure you're okay?
You're-You're fine?

764
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:37,774
Yeah, I'm...

765
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,401
I'm just going
to take a shower...

766
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,370
and get into bed.

767
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,955
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. Yeah.

768
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:51,124
I mean, do you want
to stay here tonight?

769
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,876
- Stay?
- Yeah, with me.

770
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:59,015
I mean, you probably think
I'm being slutty or something, but...

771
01:06:59,142 --> 01:07:01,811
I'm feeling bad,
and you're feeling bad.

772
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:04,302
And I'd really like
for you to stay.

773
01:07:04,439 --> 01:07:06,147
I-I just don't th...

774
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,393
Yeah. Sure, why not?

775
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:12,067
- Yeah?
- No, no, I can't.

776
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:15,649
I mean, I'm, I'm still clinging
to-to hope.

777
01:07:15,743 --> 01:07:19,077
And if-if I...
I mean, if-if we, you know...

778
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:22,083
Holy...

779
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:26,580
- No!
- No?

780
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:28,959
N-No, I...

781
01:07:30,218 --> 01:07:32,590
Are you sure?

782
01:07:34,473 --> 01:07:37,011
Oh, yeah.

783
01:07:37,101 --> 01:07:40,600
Yeah, no, I seem
to be leaving the room.

784
01:07:50,407 --> 01:07:52,067
Breadfruit.

785
01:07:53,994 --> 01:07:56,402
- It's not bread.
- It's not fruit.

786
01:08:10,388 --> 01:08:12,297
I want to kiss you.

787
01:08:17,062 --> 01:08:19,304
I really liked kissing you.

788
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,314
I liked kissing you.

789
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:28,358
But?

790
01:08:30,911 --> 01:08:33,533
But if I start,
I'm not gonna be able to stop.

791
01:08:38,043 --> 01:08:40,369
- Sounds good.
- Doesn't it?

792
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:43,169
I-I... Oh.

793
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,794
I can't.

794
01:09:04,031 --> 01:09:06,357
We should get some sleep.

795
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:16,328
Come here.

796
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:28,549
This feels good.

797
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:33,597
And safe.
Feels good and safe.

798
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:16,687
Good morning.

799
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:20,320
Wh... What-What are you doin'?

800
01:10:20,407 --> 01:10:22,982
- I got a plan.
- Good.

801
01:10:23,078 --> 01:10:26,862
Anything I can do to help?

802
01:10:26,957 --> 01:10:28,535
Yeah.

803
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,039
Yeah, just a second.

804
01:10:39,095 --> 01:10:40,589
What is it?
What's wrong?

805
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:43,676
Angelica, the helicopter's
going up in 20 minutes.

806
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:45,890
If you're going, vite, huh?

807
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,811
Oh, Geez, I didn't realize
it was...

808
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:50,643
Okay. Thank you, Phillippe.
Tell them I am on my way, okay?

809
01:10:56,364 --> 01:10:58,487
The helicopter's going up
in 20 minutes.

810
01:10:58,617 --> 01:11:01,701
Oh, God. What did...
What did I do?

811
01:11:01,787 --> 01:11:03,910
And how many times
did I do it?

812
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:08,375
- Are you okay?
- Huh? No, no. This was wrong.
This was all wrong.

813
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:11,213
Excuse me?
How could you say that?

814
01:11:11,297 --> 01:11:14,584
No, I mean, everything you did
was very right.

815
01:11:14,677 --> 01:11:17,547
But what I did was wrong!
This was wrong!

816
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:23,595
No, no. It's just we are
going through a terrible ordeal.

817
01:11:23,687 --> 01:11:26,439
It's like when after a funeral...

818
01:11:26,565 --> 01:11:29,269
- Yeah?
- Everybody has sex.

819
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:32,775
Not everybody.

820
01:11:32,905 --> 01:11:34,613
- No?
- No!

821
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:35,779
Oh.

822
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:05,977
What?

823
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:11,780
Nothin'.

824
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:16,781
You know that woman
I was tellin' you about?

825
01:12:18,372 --> 01:12:22,039
- The heartbreaker?
- She was my wife.

826
01:12:22,169 --> 01:12:25,502
- Oh.
- Twelve years.

827
01:12:27,883 --> 01:12:29,591
You have any kids?

828
01:12:31,137 --> 01:12:33,841
No, we didn't have
any kids, thank God.

829
01:12:33,973 --> 01:12:36,594
But I always wanted kids.

830
01:12:36,726 --> 01:12:39,810
- A bunch of them.
- Really?

831
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,689
There's still time.

832
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,195
What? Come on.

833
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,611
How old are you?

834
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:52,699
Well, what do...

835
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:54,785
How old do you think I am?

836
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,365
- Hmm. Let me think.
- Guess.

837
01:13:00,044 --> 01:13:01,454
Forty-five.

838
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,548
Forty-eight?

839
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,839
Fifty. You fifty?

840
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:17,095
You still look good.

841
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,437
I still am good.

842
01:13:28,409 --> 01:13:31,245
Let's get these apart.
We gotta take 'em down one by one.

843
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,996
You first.

844
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:41,376
Careful!

845
01:14:15,586 --> 01:14:18,956
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

846
01:14:20,967 --> 01:14:23,754
Okay, your turn.

847
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:37,191
How can I eat?
I'm scum! I'm garbage!

848
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:41,863
This experience has tested me and has
revealed no character whatsoever.

849
01:14:41,991 --> 01:14:45,241
Stop beating yourself up.
You're a guy. You can't help it.

850
01:14:51,043 --> 01:14:53,830
Mr Martin, forgive me.

851
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:56,209
I just heard they decided
to call off the search.

852
01:14:56,339 --> 01:14:58,214
I'm sorry.

853
01:14:59,718 --> 01:15:01,628
That's it?

854
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:14,581
Okay!

855
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:24,021
It's working!

856
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:21,162
Keep comin'!

857
01:17:25,964 --> 01:17:27,958
Push!

858
01:17:54,164 --> 01:17:56,322
- Ready?
- All right!

859
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:58,492
Put her down!

860
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:44,084
Oh, shit. Look!

861
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:09,401
Get out of here!

862
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,581
Too far back to the right.

863
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,765
Oh, God. Are you okay?

864
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:35,858
Oh, you're hit!

865
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:38,061
It's not bad.

866
01:19:38,196 --> 01:19:40,272
It's not bad.

867
01:19:42,033 --> 01:19:44,821
Come on, come on!

868
01:19:46,121 --> 01:19:48,280
I'm in! I'm in!
Get in the plane! Hurry!

869
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:51,868
Hurry!

870
01:19:59,052 --> 01:20:00,961
All right! Hurry up!

871
01:20:17,573 --> 01:20:20,064
Take off!
Come on!

872
01:20:22,745 --> 01:20:24,703
Fire!

873
01:20:28,793 --> 01:20:31,036
Damn! Get out of the way!

874
01:20:35,343 --> 01:20:38,344
Reload! Quickly!

875
01:20:49,943 --> 01:20:53,026
Take off! Take off!

876
01:20:57,826 --> 01:21:00,069
We're gonna hit 'em!

877
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:04,446
We're gonna hit 'em!

878
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,493
Gimme a hand! Pull!

879
01:21:06,627 --> 01:21:08,917
- Pull!
- Pull.

880
01:21:25,482 --> 01:21:27,807
- Look out!
- Abandon ship!

881
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:42,410
Come on. Come on.
Stay with me here.

882
01:21:42,501 --> 01:21:45,206
Stay with me.
You're doin' great.

883
01:21:45,337 --> 01:21:48,422
- Come on.
- Look.

884
01:21:48,508 --> 01:21:51,959
I should tell you
a few things about aeroplanes.

885
01:21:52,053 --> 01:21:53,797
Why is that?

886
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:58,468
'Cause I may not be conscious
when it comes time to land this thing.

887
01:21:58,602 --> 01:22:00,310
Oh, shit.

888
01:22:00,438 --> 01:22:04,435
Take the controls. I want you
to get a feel for the yoke.

889
01:22:04,525 --> 01:22:07,313
You're serious, aren't you?

890
01:22:09,906 --> 01:22:12,824
I got it.

891
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:14,991
- Okay.
- Okay. Sm... Hey! Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

892
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:16,989
- Small corrections.
- Sorry.

893
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:21,162
Small corrections.
Just look at the horizon.

894
01:22:21,294 --> 01:22:22,955
When we get there...

895
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:26,712
you're gonna line up about
a hundred feet out from the beach.

896
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,253
Hundred feet out from the beach.

897
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:56,164
We are here today...

898
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:59,417
to honour two fine people:
Miss Robin Monroe...

899
01:22:59,544 --> 01:23:02,001
and an old friend, Mr...

900
01:23:02,089 --> 01:23:07,085
Father, please forgive me, for I have
sinned. I've been bad. Very bad.

901
01:23:19,276 --> 01:23:20,936
Oh, God.

902
01:23:21,069 --> 01:23:23,904
Quinn?

903
01:23:24,031 --> 01:23:28,029
Quinn, don't make me do this alone.
Please, Quinn, don't make me
do this alone.

904
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:29,530
Shit.

905
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:38,872
I would say a few words
about our friend.

906
01:23:38,964 --> 01:23:41,456
Quinn Norris was the kind of man...

907
01:23:53,147 --> 01:23:56,563
It's Quinny! It's Quinny!

908
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:59,224
Look!

909
01:24:02,157 --> 01:24:05,241
All right.
I'm lined up with the beach.

910
01:24:07,496 --> 01:24:11,114
Throttle to 65 knots.

911
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,124
What the hell's a knot?

912
01:24:13,252 --> 01:24:15,459
It's Quinny! Look!

913
01:24:17,174 --> 01:24:20,459
Thank... Thank you, God!

914
01:24:20,593 --> 01:24:23,880
Uh, flaps. Flaps, flaps.

915
01:24:25,224 --> 01:24:26,599
All right.

916
01:24:26,684 --> 01:24:29,804
Nose slightly elevated for landing.
Here we go.

917
01:24:29,896 --> 01:24:32,980
And... Help me, God!

918
01:24:59,971 --> 01:25:01,679
I'm coming, Sweetie!

919
01:25:10,107 --> 01:25:13,856
Quinn? Quinn? Quinn!

920
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:19,860
We did it.

921
01:25:23,914 --> 01:25:25,824
I'm coming! Robin!

922
01:25:25,917 --> 01:25:28,668
Sweetie, hold...

923
01:25:28,753 --> 01:25:32,122
Robin! Oh, my God, you're alive!

924
01:25:32,257 --> 01:25:34,665
- You're hurt! You're hurt!
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

925
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,094
- He needs a doctor.
Get him... Get him a doctor.
- A doctor! We need a doctor!

926
01:25:43,311 --> 01:25:46,396
- Come on, sweetie.
- Quinny? Are you okay, baby?

927
01:25:46,522 --> 01:25:49,061
- Can you move your leg?
- Be careful!

928
01:25:49,193 --> 01:25:51,731
- Watch out.
- Are you okay, baby?

929
01:25:51,862 --> 01:25:54,400
I'm okay.

930
01:25:54,531 --> 01:25:56,405
- Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.
- Be careful.

931
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:13,466
- They brought the tea!
- Oh, great.

932
01:26:13,595 --> 01:26:15,801
You want some honey, sweetie?

933
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:17,305
Sure.

934
01:26:17,432 --> 01:26:19,306
The guy said
the hotel's offered us...

935
01:26:19,434 --> 01:26:21,593
a month's free stay
anytime we want.

936
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,020
They're probably afraid
I'm gonna sue them.

937
01:26:28,194 --> 01:26:32,442
- How are you feeling? Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah. I'm just, you know, tired.

938
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:40,122
Here we go.
Whoops. Sorry.

939
01:26:40,249 --> 01:26:42,456
Are you okay?

940
01:26:44,754 --> 01:26:47,958
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep.

941
01:26:48,091 --> 01:26:50,297
Frank, Come here. Come here.

942
01:26:50,427 --> 01:26:51,969
Sit down.

943
01:26:55,683 --> 01:26:57,557
It was terrible.

944
01:26:57,685 --> 01:27:00,224
I mean...

945
01:27:00,355 --> 01:27:04,353
I think deep down, I, uh,
I never expected to see you again.

946
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,977
You know, I was...

947
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,527
I was lost. I was...

948
01:27:11,743 --> 01:27:15,112
We're just people, you know.
You know?

949
01:27:15,205 --> 01:27:19,583
Robin, we're not perfect. I mean,
under... under that kind of pressure...

950
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:22,202
I mean, people do things.

951
01:27:22,339 --> 01:27:25,007
You don't know... right, wrong...
You're cra... You're nuts.

952
01:27:25,091 --> 01:27:27,084
You know, you...

953
01:27:54,332 --> 01:27:55,827
Hi.

954
01:27:55,917 --> 01:27:58,622
Hi.

955
01:28:00,672 --> 01:28:02,001
Keepin' busy?

956
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:05,959
Yeah.

957
01:28:06,095 --> 01:28:08,053
How are you?

958
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:11,306
Good. Good, thanks.
This is not so bad.

959
01:28:11,434 --> 01:28:13,178
- How 'bout you, your...
- It's fine.

960
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,978
Good.

961
01:28:19,945 --> 01:28:23,028
What's the deal here?

962
01:28:23,114 --> 01:28:27,064
- Deal?
- With us.

963
01:28:29,955 --> 01:28:31,912
What do you mean?

964
01:28:31,999 --> 01:28:33,825
You know what I mean.

965
01:28:44,304 --> 01:28:47,258
Was what happened
on that island anything?

966
01:28:49,393 --> 01:28:51,267
Or was it just something
that happens to two people...

967
01:28:51,395 --> 01:28:54,101
when they're alone
on an island together?

968
01:28:56,151 --> 01:28:58,060
It was something.

969
01:29:00,488 --> 01:29:02,565
Something?

970
01:29:02,658 --> 01:29:03,939
Yeah.

971
01:29:05,328 --> 01:29:08,114
So...

972
01:29:08,247 --> 01:29:10,121
now what?

973
01:29:12,836 --> 01:29:16,455
Look, I'm... I'm pretty set
in my ways, and...

974
01:29:16,549 --> 01:29:18,790
you got all kinds
of possibilities.

975
01:29:18,926 --> 01:29:21,002
You deserve someone...

976
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:23,967
fresher.

977
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:29,477
Don't you think
that's up to me to decide?

978
01:29:30,647 --> 01:29:33,317
Let's be smart about this.

979
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,817
You're not gonna move out here
and become my copilot.

980
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:40,275
And I'm not gonna go to New York
and be your receptionist, so...

981
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,950
Where does that leave us?

982
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,613
I don't know.
I guess it leaves us nowhere.

983
01:29:50,045 --> 01:29:52,832
So let's not complicate things.

984
01:29:53,965 --> 01:29:56,800
Oh, I forgot
you like things simple.

985
01:29:58,387 --> 01:29:59,668
Right.

986
01:29:59,764 --> 01:30:01,673
All right.

987
01:30:13,403 --> 01:30:16,274
Well, good luck.

988
01:30:17,908 --> 01:30:19,866
Good luck to you too.

989
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:24,788
I hope everything works out...

990
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:26,790
for you.

991
01:30:32,342 --> 01:30:35,378
So, how's that shoulder today?

992
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,713
Need something for the pain?

993
01:30:37,848 --> 01:30:39,757
Yeah.

994
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:06,663
Well, 14 more hours,
then back to reality.

995
01:31:11,301 --> 01:31:13,757
- Frank?
- Hmm?

996
01:31:13,845 --> 01:31:17,012
I don't think
we should get married.

997
01:31:17,141 --> 01:31:19,467
What?

998
01:31:19,602 --> 01:31:22,177
How come?

999
01:31:22,314 --> 01:31:25,150
Because I think it's wrong
for two people...

1000
01:31:25,275 --> 01:31:28,442
to get married when something is
hanging over their heads.

1001
01:31:30,656 --> 01:31:32,696
Oh, my God, I'm sorry!
Robin, I'm sorry!

1002
01:31:32,825 --> 01:31:35,151
I was... I was...
I was distraught.

1003
01:31:35,287 --> 01:31:38,038
And then she-she took off her blouse,
and it was like, "Oh, my God."

1004
01:31:38,164 --> 01:31:40,371
But I...
I walked away. I did.

1005
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,171
I went back to our room. I tried
to go to sleep, but I thought of you.

1006
01:31:43,296 --> 01:31:46,167
I thought, oh... I didn't know
if you were dead or what.

1007
01:31:46,299 --> 01:31:49,134
So I went back to her bungalow,
you know, just... just to...

1008
01:31:49,219 --> 01:31:52,303
And she...
Robin, she answered the door with...

1009
01:31:54,433 --> 01:31:55,975
On.

1010
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,969
- Who?
- Angelica.

1011
01:31:59,105 --> 01:32:02,640
- You slept with Angelica?
- Who slept? Are you ki...

1012
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,488
- Didn't you know?
- How would I know?

1013
01:32:09,283 --> 01:32:11,524
Wait a minute. You just said
there was something hanging over our...

1014
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,534
What did...
Wh-What do you mean?

1015
01:32:15,331 --> 01:32:16,611
Quinn and me.

1016
01:32:16,707 --> 01:32:19,460
- Aha!
- Oh, Frank...

1017
01:32:19,545 --> 01:32:21,834
something happened.

1018
01:32:21,963 --> 01:32:26,127
Something happened that shouldn't have
happened if you and I were really...

1019
01:32:26,218 --> 01:32:28,127
In love.

1020
01:32:51,413 --> 01:32:54,829
Boarding flight number 58
to Honolulu.

1021
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:58,203
All ticketed passengers
should board immediately.

1022
01:33:46,641 --> 01:33:48,550
- Hey!
- Sorry.

1023
01:33:49,645 --> 01:33:51,519
Hey!

1024
01:33:58,529 --> 01:34:00,855
Hey, hey.

1025
01:34:00,991 --> 01:34:03,861
- Where's the plane... plane to New York?
- Right there.

1026
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:39,156
I-I'm sorry.
I just had to get off the plane.

1027
01:34:39,284 --> 01:34:41,774
Well, I'm sorry
I delayed the flight. I just...

1028
01:34:50,003 --> 01:34:55,674
Where are my bags?
You don't speak any English?

1029
01:34:59,223 --> 01:35:01,594
What's in my bags is illegal?

1030
01:35:01,725 --> 01:35:04,097
Wait a minute.
Oh, please don't search my bags.

1031
01:35:04,227 --> 01:35:06,304
It's just important
that I stay.

1032
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,113
You're here!

1033
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,841
Why... Why did you
get off the plane?

1034
01:35:32,926 --> 01:35:35,632
Wh-Why didn't you...
Why did you come here?

1035
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:40,884
I've decided
my life is too simple.

1036
01:35:42,228 --> 01:35:43,687
It is?

1037
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:47,722
Yeah. I w... I want to
c-complicate the hell out of it.

1038
01:36:04,669 --> 01:36:07,042
So, uh, where are we goin'?

1039
01:36:07,131 --> 01:36:10,168
Um, your place is
in New York, right?

1040
01:36:10,301 --> 01:36:11,761
Uh-huh.

1041
01:36:11,887 --> 01:36:14,258
I don't think I can wait that long.
How 'bout my place?

1042
01:36:14,388 --> 01:36:16,963
Oh, yeah. Your little house
on the beach.

1043
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,259
More like a shack, actually.

1044
01:36:19,395 --> 01:36:22,313
- A shack.
- It's, uh... It's not much.

1045
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:25,311
Uh-huh. You do have a bed,
don't you?

1046
01:36:25,443 --> 01:36:27,483
Are you gonna be this fussy
about everything?

1047
01:36:27,611 --> 01:36:29,521
I wanna love ya

1048
01:36:31,033 --> 01:36:33,440
And treat you right

1049
01:36:33,577 --> 01:36:35,451
I wanna love ya

Every day and every night

01:36:40,919 --> 01:36:43,291
We'll be together

1052
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:48,794
With a roof right over our head

1053
01:36:48,927 --> 01:36:51,383
We'll share the shelter

1054
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:56,805
Of my single bed

1055
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:00,145
We'll share the same room, yeah

1056
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:05,395
But Jah provide the bread

1057
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:08,365

01:37:08,491 --> 01:37:11,160

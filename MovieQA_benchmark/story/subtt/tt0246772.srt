1
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:08,413
I love to
serve them roasted.

2
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:11,964
It gives them
a more robust taste.

3
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:16,124
A wonderful
side dish would be ravioli

4
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:20,303
with boletus
or truffles, per season.

5
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,223
But you need a good pigeon

6
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:28,964
You could also cook them
in a pig's bladder

7
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:34,405
in Madeira, cognac and port.

8
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:39,533
It keeps the pigeon
safe and juicy.

9
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,132
Serve it with tagliatelle
with onions,

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:47,133
truffles and shallots
in a thyme sauce.

11
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:50,932
Truffles are perfect
for pigeon dish,

12
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:54,653
because the delicate
pigeon flavor...

13
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:58,153
Do you feel ill?
- No, no.

14
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:00,245
Please go on.

15
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:08,013
Start with crayfish, mussels...
- Martha.

16
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:12,093
May I change the subject
for a moment?

17
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:15,253
Yes.

18
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:22,093
Why do you come to therapy
every week?

19
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,413
Why do you ask?

20
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,842
Well, I thought perhaps...

21
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:31,882
it might be helpful to know.

22
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:41,132
My boss says she'll fire me
if I don't go to therapy.

23
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:46,543
Why do you think your
boss believes you need therapy?

24
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:50,242
You know what?
I have no idea.

25
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,409
Table 19 has asked
for the cheque.

26
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,530
On with 14!
- When is 6 ready? -4 minutes.

27
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:53,769
Gregor says the lamb is great.
- The Steinbergs are here.

28
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,529
I'm busy.
- Martha, please.

29
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,209
2 rucola salads,
one without the duck.

30
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,849
Not too long, or...
- I know.

31
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,369
Dry, Lea.
Qualis go dry, not tough.

32
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,609
And hold off table 9.
- Yes

33
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Let's go through next week's menu
later. - Okay. Lea, table 14!

34
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,608
The quails were tremendous!
Amazing! Magical! -I'm glad.

35
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,569
My husband worships you.
I'm jealous!

36
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,729
I worship everyone who tickles
my palate.

37
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,049
Heaven knows why he married me.

38
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,089
He won't allow me
to make a cup of tea.

39
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,169
There's one thing lonelier
than sleeping alone:

40
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,401
eating alone.
And I love you.

41
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:49,121
Excuse me.

42
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,889
Table 9 asks what this is.
- Lemon thyme.

43
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,289
Should I remove the plate?
- Please.

44
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,529
What is it? -I'll handle it.
- Now what?

45
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,128
I wanna talk to the chef!
- I'm the chef.

46
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,847
Is that so?

47
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:07,608
Bernd, please!
- You stay out of this!

48
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:10,646
Your foie gras is undercooked!

49
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,488
Excuse me?
- I'll take it off the bill.

50
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:16,689
Never!
- My foie gras is not undercooked!

51
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,648
Believe me, dear,
I know what's what.

52
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:23,968
I am not your dear! This was
perfectly poached at 140C in the oven,

53
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,328
and a water temp.
of 80, for 25 minutes.

54
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,648
And it's got the right rose color.

55
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,568
"Comme il faut,"
as the French say.

56
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,648
I don't give a damn!
It's undercooked!

57
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,368
Would you like something else?

58
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,608
Casting pearls before swines
- What!?

59
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,888
D'you think you are
at a snack bar?

60
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,448
You want liverwurst,
go someplace else!

61
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,179
Excuse me, please

62
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,248
Why not pour out the wine too!
With all that smoking

63
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,528
you won't taste it anyway!

64
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:54,167
I'll never cook for you again!

65
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:57,988
I told you
to pull yourself together!

66
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,448
No, you always
have to make a scene!

67
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,528
He's a barbarian!
- He's a customer!

68
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,008
If he says it's undercooked,
then it is!

69
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,208
It's cruelty to geese!
- Shut it!

70
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:11,887
It's perfect!
Not a matter of taste.

71
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:13,847
I know.
But the customer is king.

72
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:16,268
And who am I? The fool?

73
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:20,167
If you weren't the second
best cook in the city

74
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:22,818
I'd fire you on the spot!

75
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:27,088
Second?
What's that supposed to mean?

76
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,869
What does she mean by that?

77
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,487
She only said it to annoy me

78
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:38,327
I'm sure she only said it
to annoy me.

79
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:42,378
One knows a good chef
by simple dishes.

80
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,709
For instance salmon
in light basil sauce.

81
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:55,807
Most people think it's no big deal
and put it on the menu.

82
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,487
But frying or steaming
it just right

83
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:05,488
and putting the right amount of salt
and spices in the sauce is difficult

84
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:10,158
In this recipe
there's no distraction,

85
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,517
no design,

86
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,418
no exotic ingredient.

87
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,318
There's only the fish

88
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:22,958
and the sauce.
The fish and the sauce

89
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:50,308
Just a minute!

90
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:55,882
Yes?
- You're the new neighbour?

91
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,646
Was the music too loud?
- No.

92
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:02,107
I live in the apartment above you.

93
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:06,086
And I thought,
as you have only just moved in

94
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,086
You can't have settled in yet.

95
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,767
Yeah, it's all a bit chaotic.

96
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:14,828
I haven't had time to clear
it all up.

97
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:21,457
I've made something to eat.
You hungry?

98
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:25,517
Are you inviting me to dinner?
- No...

99
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:28,587
I could bring you something.

100
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:31,085
You don't even know me!

101
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:35,239
You're Samuel Thalberg.
An architect,

102
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:39,327
divorced, 2 kids.
Friends call you Sam.

103
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:43,877
Frau Schumann talks too much.

104
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:46,126
The gossip in the basement.

105
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,325
Don't listen to her,
she thinks I'm nuts.

106
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,605
And you are?
- A chef.

107
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:53,805
Martha Klein.
- Nice to meet you, Martha.

108
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:57,286
If you're hungry...
- I've an appointment.

109
00:09:57,287 --> 00:10:00,606
I'm sorry.
Don't let me keep you.

110
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:04,361
Maybe some other time.
- Yes, maybe.

111
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,126
What'll I cook?

112
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:11,005
Nothing, we'll order pizza
or eat out.

113
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,365
No, that's out of the question.

114
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,042
What does Lina like?
- Everything.

115
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:20,486
Except oysters.
Nothing that's alive.

116
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,045
No oysters, okay.
- Hang on.

117
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:26,005
Lina, I've told you
a hundred times

118
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:28,885
to take off
your rollerskates outside!

119
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:31,725
Sorry. You still there?
- Yes.

120
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:35,866
Mom!
- I'm talking. What are your plans?

121
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:39,925
No plans.
- Go to the theatre, the movies.

122
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:41,845
It's your day off, right?

123
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:45,085
Call a friend,
have a nice meal,

124
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:47,645
go dancing afterwards.
- Maybe I will.

125
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,125
But do it,
don't just say you will.

126
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:52,879
Who is it?
- It's Martha.

127
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,365
I'll see you on Friday.
- Okay.

128
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,244
I'm not compulsive,
I'm precise!

129
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:02,335
Precision's most important
in a kitchen.

130
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:04,696
Precision and timing.

131
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:08,965
Have any idea how complicated it is
to coordinate 47 customers?

132
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,485
Logistics is half the battle.

133
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:15,436
Can't master logistics?
Forget cooking.

134
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,345
I hope you like mussels.

135
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:33,964
We agreed you wouldn't
cook for me.

136
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:36,004
I didn't cook it for you.

137
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:38,604
I've just tried out something.

138
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:44,164
You want me to throw it all away
just because you've got principles?

139
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,905
If you'd at least join me,

140
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:50,736
I'd say that
we're making progress.

141
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:07,365
That's a good one!
- Calm down!

142
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:12,883
One with the hair loose,
one tied up.

143
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:23,923
I just looked at him and said:

144
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:26,843
"If you're looking for an actress
who strips

145
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:30,042
"and lets a priest whip her,

146
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:34,395
"you're wrong!"
- Only in her spare time.

147
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,804
Like the guy at table 17
who brings a different chick

148
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:41,114
every Friday: rich but uptight!

149
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,523
The special for the Steinbergs.
No salad for him.

150
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,394
she wants it after the fish.

151
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:49,243
If he stares at my tits again,

152
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:52,534
he's in for it!
Tip or no tip.

153
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,123
Now I've to ask him
to be patient!

154
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,444
You must eat something.

155
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:19,974
Could someone
answer the damn phone!?

156
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:24,763
If it's my sister,
I'll be home at one.

157
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:27,723
Yes, she's here.
Martha, for you

158
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,043
I'm busy!

159
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,954
Keep an eye on it

160
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:37,564
Yes...?

161
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,514
I'm on my way

162
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,961
Hello, dear, it's me again

163
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:25,442
I wanted to let you know
we'll be late.

164
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:30,562
I had to see Lina's teacher,
and that took forever,

165
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,882
so we hit the road
way too late.

166
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:37,321
I don't know what time it is now,
but I've got about 200 km to go.

167
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:39,921
So don't worry
when I'm not there.

168
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:41,640
See you, bye.

169
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,721
Miss Klein?

170
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,972
Have you seen Lina yet?

171
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,661
I was just going to.

172
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:36,041
No one has told her
about her mother yet.

173
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,822
Do you know
how to reach her father?

174
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:43,880
Christin didn't keep
in touch with him.

175
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:48,511
I don't even know his name.
- I see.

176
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:51,830
Excuse me.

177
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,961
Lina hasn't touched her food.
Could you talk to her?

178
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:59,462
She should eat something.

179
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,261
I will.
- Good luck.

180
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,521
Does it hurt real bad?

181
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:27,511
Don't you want to eat anything?

182
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,879
You know what?

183
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:45,281
When they let you out,

184
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:52,111
I'll cook you
the best dinner you've ever had.

185
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,875
Is Mom dead?

186
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:08,149
Yes.

187
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:29,599
If Martha doesn't find a replacement
soon, I'll have my baby right here.

188
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,790
My friend has been
in bed for 6 weeks...

189
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,120
In the tank,

190
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,150
a lobster eats itself
slowly from the inside.

191
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,840
You have to weigh
it when you buy it.

192
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,870
If it's not as heavy as it looks,

193
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,330
it has been in the tank too long

194
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:29,079
Some people still kill a lobster
by throwing it in boiling water.

195
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,150
But by now everyone knows

196
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,838
that for the animal
it's the most agonizing death,

197
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,939
because it takes
so long for it to die.

198
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,119
The best way to kill a lobster is
with a well-placed stab in the neck.

199
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,189
It's quickest

200
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,579
I'll be right there.

201
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,551
Go home, Martha.

202
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,198
I just need a minute.
I'll be all right.

203
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:24,429
You don't understand.
It's no suggestion.

204
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,369
I want you to go home.

205
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,439
I've brought us something.

206
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:11,955
I'm not hungry.

207
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,597
Neither am I.

208
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:30,237
Would you rather get some sleep?

209
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,876
I'm not tired.

210
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,110
This Friday you can go home.

211
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:45,190
Did you know that?
- Yes.

212
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:51,198
You and I need to talk
about what to do.

213
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:53,848
Can I go back home?

214
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,636
I'm afraid you can't.

215
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,355
Why not?

216
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:03,078
You'd be all alone there.

217
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:05,608
I've been alone a lot.

218
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,154
But your Mom would
always come home.

219
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:21,047
Why can't I live with my father?

220
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:27,958
What do you know
about your father?

221
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:30,338
He's called Giuseppe.

222
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:36,287
Giuseppe.
Do you know his last name?

223
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,873
From Italy.

224
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:43,267
Well, that's a start.

225
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:48,476
I'll try and find
your father, Lina.

226
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:51,396
And in the meantime you could
live with me,

227
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:53,228
if you like.

228
00:22:54,397 --> 00:22:58,537
What do you think?
- Until you find him?

229
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,828
Until I find him.

230
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:56,466
I don't want to eat.

231
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,556
Rather have something else?

232
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:12,355
Aren't you hungry at all?

233
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:21,075
May I go back
to my room now, please?

234
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:44,914
I have to go out
for a moment. - Okay

235
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:48,954
Your dinner's in the oven.
- Okay

236
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,515
Do you need anything else?

237
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:57,485
Right, I'm off then

238
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:14,565
I didn't see you come in.

239
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:19,345
I was on my way out.
I forgot something.

240
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,724
So, how are you?

241
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:26,908
Fine.

242
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,605
Have you had dinner?

243
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:35,144
Today?
- This evening, yes...

244
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,473
Neither have I. Would you like
to have dinner with me?

245
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,534
I'm sorry, I can't right now.

246
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,354
That's too bad.

247
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:49,785
Maybe some other time.

248
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,866
Yes, maybe.

249
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:58,414
Bye.
- Hadn't you forgotten something?

250
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:01,992
Yes, of course.

251
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:05,464
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

252
00:27:23,594 --> 00:27:25,788
I'm off now.
- Okay.

253
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,793
Only a well-fed cook
is a good cook.

254
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:54,313
First you must saturate
your taste buds

255
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:56,393
and only then season to taste.

256
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:58,473
If you're satisfied
on a full stomach,

257
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:01,664
then you're a really good cook.

258
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,987
What are you doing here?

259
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:17,672
Tell me the secret
of your saffron sauce.

260
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:21,952
I beg your pardon?
- Lea didn't want to show me and...

261
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:23,386
Listen!

262
00:28:34,553 --> 00:28:38,143
How he savours the song!
Fantastic.

263
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,226
Martha...

264
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:48,923
I meant to call you.
This is Mario.

265
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,583
This is Martha, our chef.

266
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,431
Believe me,
the world would be a sad place

267
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,792
without your pigeon with truffles.

268
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:01,472
You could've asked!

269
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:05,392
You had other worries.
- But... - Evening.

270
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:08,512
Booked a table?
- Yes, Mendel. For two.

271
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,231
Let me show you to your table.

272
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,231
Great. A madman in my kitchen!

273
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:16,271
It's my kitchen
and he isn't mad.

274
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,671
He's eccentric.
Your coats, please

275
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:20,512
Eccentric? Are you mad?

276
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:23,592
An Italian!
- Someone'll be with you soon

277
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:27,231
We agreed
that I would choose my staff.

278
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,751
Lea would've coped
for a few days.

279
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:32,111
And what does he want
my recipe for?

280
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:35,431
I... - Clm down!
I needed a replacement

281
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:39,271
He's a superb cook.
Be glad he's here.

282
00:29:39,272 --> 00:29:42,192
Lea shouldn't work at all
after 8.

283
00:29:42,193 --> 00:29:44,991
Soon we'll have to do
without her.

284
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,682
If we're lucky,
Mario will stay on.

285
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:53,342
He could do the fish dishes.

286
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:56,152
Hang on! The fish dishes!?

287
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:00,069
You know we've got to change.

288
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:02,670
Nowadays people
want light dishes.

289
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:06,471
They watch their diet,
their cholesterol,

290
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,511
blood pressure,
salt content of water!

291
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:11,311
Olive oil instead of butter.
Light!

292
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:14,111
Want to get rid of me?
Tell me now!

293
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:18,262
When I do,
you'll be the first to know!

294
00:30:57,591 --> 00:30:59,263
Good morning

295
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:08,941
Didn't I have
to go to school today?

296
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,827
It's 8:30.

297
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:16,749
8:30?

298
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:22,910
D'you need anything?
A pen? Maybe paper?

299
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:24,503
No, thanks

300
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:29,491
Want to take sandwiches?
- No, thanks.

301
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,430
I can't find my scarf.
- Hurry up.

302
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,391
Put on your jacket.

303
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,749
I won't go without my scarf!

304
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,069
What did you say?
- I can't find my scarf.

305
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,549
You can have mine.
- I want mine!

306
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,588
We're late. Put on mine today

307
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:57,430
and yours tomorrow, okay?

308
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,221
Is that it?
- Yes.

309
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,670
Thank God!
- But I didn't put it on him.

310
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,784
There!

311
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,350
Good morning.

312
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,906
I'll get you some.

313
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,222
Good morning.

314
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,102
Who are you?

315
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,970
I'm Sam, your neighbour.

316
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,749
There you are.
- Thank you.

317
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,480
Have you had breakfast yet?

318
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,250
No, but we've got
to get to school.

319
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,500
Isn't she a little too old
for that?

320
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,510
Goodbye.
- See you around.

321
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:17,868
Why go to school
if I'm going to Italy?

322
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:21,499
Because all children
go to school.

323
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,589
I don't know
when I'll find your father.

324
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,829
Have you started looking at all?

325
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,700
I don't really know
where to start. - In Italy!

326
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:37,419
Two chefs in one kitchen is like...

327
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:44,439
Like 2 people driving a car.
Impossible.

328
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:51,299
My wife and I often drive together.

329
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:56,419
But you're not both
behind the wheel.

330
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:05,821
You'll manage to avoid the worst.

331
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,103
The worst?

332
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:15,419
That he'll put up
with you for a while.

333
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:20,708
Are you this nice to all
your patients?

334
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:23,669
Only to those who deserve it.

335
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:53,668
I know you don't need
a babysitter,

336
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:57,787
but this way
I'll know you've everything.

337
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,387
I don't need anything.

338
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,777
Or if anything happens,

339
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:06,538
like a fire,
I don't want you to be alone.

340
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,828
She's probably nicer
than she looks.

341
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:15,627
And she brought a book,
to read to you.

342
00:35:15,628 --> 00:35:17,498
I can read myself.

343
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:22,048
Maybe a game.
- Haven't you got any?

344
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:27,859
When will you be back?
- Late.

345
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:32,186
It's ready.
Veal's in the fridge,

346
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:34,227
everything else is here.

347
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:36,738
All you have to do is...

348
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:38,187
Heat it up.

349
00:35:39,228 --> 00:35:41,098
Here's the recipe.

350
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,427
You can cook, can't you?

351
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:46,261
Not a bit.
- Great!

352
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:52,779
Why, why, why...?

353
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:57,307
Hire a detective.

354
00:35:57,308 --> 00:36:00,787
No. They find nothing,
and cost a fortune.

355
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:03,787
My sister once hired a detective
to find her ex-boyfriend.

356
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,380
He bled her,

357
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:08,746
but never found him.
- Just what I said.

358
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:11,027
Isn't Mario there yet?

359
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:19,137
Maybe changed his mind.
- Don't you dare!

360
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:39,021
Good day.

361
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:42,466
Missed out on something?
- Not really.

362
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:46,247
We've been working here
for an hour.

363
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:52,260
Okay.

364
00:37:24,147 --> 00:37:25,546
Hey, chef.

365
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,665
No, thank you.

366
00:37:37,106 --> 00:37:40,066
I never eat in the afternoon.

367
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:51,985
Martha, my mother whispered this
recipe to me on her deathbed.

368
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:55,505
It's been a family secret
for centuries.

369
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:59,286
I made it especially
for all of you.

370
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:03,646
You can't say no,
that's impossible.

371
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:07,895
The memory of my mama is more...

372
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:14,784
Satisfied?

373
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:16,858
Yes, very.

374
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:25,544
I thought your mother
lived in Nice. - Yes, no.

375
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:28,905
We thought she wasn't
going to make it,

376
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,956
but then...
It was a miracle!

377
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:26,784
Table 15: 3 tureens, 1 rucola salad,
1 angler, 2 lambs. 6 minutes

378
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:28,655
Lia are you ready?

379
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:34,904
Carlos, 1 lobster, 3 artichokes

380
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,915
Let me know if you need help.

381
00:39:38,705 --> 00:39:41,255
Lea, table 3, 30 seconds.

382
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:47,975
Carry on with table 6.
- Tables 2 and 4.

383
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:52,138
Lea, now 1 quail and 1 rabbit.

384
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:25,755
Carlos, 2 rucola salads, 1 tureen.

385
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:09,614
2 mousses, quickly, please

386
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:11,897
Excuse me.

387
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:16,264
I'll need that.
- You'll get it back.

388
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:24,633
May I ask you something?
- Lf you must.

389
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:29,674
Who taught you to cook this good?

390
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:32,383
Pere Bise.

391
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:34,823
Pierre Bise!?

392
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:37,821
Pere Bise.

393
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,393
That's French for "father".

394
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:44,203
In English he'd be a pear.

395
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:51,024
What's wrong with you?

396
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:57,153
Anything wrong with my cooking?

397
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,782
It's my kitchen.
I worked hard for it.

398
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:05,753
I won't let you take it away
from me.

399
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:08,703
Why would I want to do that?

400
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:14,193
What else could you want here?

401
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:35,253
Now you listen to me.

402
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:38,012
I don't need this job.

403
00:42:38,263 --> 00:42:41,043
I can work anywhere I want.

404
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:45,181
I'd like to work here.
I admire you.

405
00:42:45,182 --> 00:42:49,242
It's an honor for me
to cook with you.

406
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,702
But most of all I like to work

407
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:56,862
where I'm wanted.
You understand, right?

408
00:42:56,863 --> 00:43:02,383
So if you want me to leave,
just say so and I'm gone

409
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:05,817
Yes?

410
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:13,052
What's going on here?

411
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:16,082
What is it you want?

412
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:33,821
Sorry, Frida, find someone else.

413
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:36,342
Why? Martha,
what have you done?

414
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:38,014
Nothing at all.

415
00:43:39,422 --> 00:43:42,021
Please stay, Mario, we need you.

416
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:45,253
I'd need to hear her say so.

417
00:43:47,182 --> 00:43:50,941
After all, it's her kitchen.
- It's mine, too. - No.

418
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:53,221
It's your restaurant,
but her kitchen.

419
00:43:53,222 --> 00:43:59,222
Without her, it's just a pile
of metal. It's for her to decide.

420
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:15,100
All right, if there's no other way.

421
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:17,251
We'll give it a try.

422
00:44:24,382 --> 00:44:26,482
You want me to stay?

423
00:44:27,222 --> 00:44:30,822
Didn't I just say so?
- Excuse me?

424
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,391
I want you to stay.

425
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:37,459
All right, I'll stay.

426
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:42,254
I'll stay.

427
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:47,212
Your towel's on fire.

428
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:54,180
"I am at Sam's"

429
00:45:02,981 --> 00:45:05,460
I'm sorry,
I'd hoped the babysitter...

430
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:09,241
That's OK.
It was a pleasant change.

431
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:12,741
How could I thank you?

432
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:16,511
You could go out with me
some time.

433
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:21,961
I don't go out.
- No? What a shame.

434
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,440
What a shame.
We could stay in together.

435
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,550
Well, good night.

436
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,840
That bitch's not coming back.
I promise.

437
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:52,611
She wouldn't come anyway.

438
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:58,461
Did you have anything to eat?

439
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,340
You want anything?
I'll make something.

440
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,337
I want to go home.

441
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,790
Sleep with me in the living room?
- No.

442
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,930
I'll stay until you fall asleep.
- No

443
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,417
All right.

444
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,651
Good night then.

445
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,419
Gnocchi?
You want to serve gnocchi!?

446
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,819
Why not?

447
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,338
I've never made gnocchi.
- That's okay.

448
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,098
Mario's, in sage butter,
are glorious.

449
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:57,099
Wonderful! Was it his idea?
- No, mine.

450
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:10,858
Gnocchi! Of all things!

451
00:47:12,979 --> 00:47:16,849
They need to be made
with great care.

452
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,570
With gnocchi you take your time.

453
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:27,218
They tend to get tough and
inedible, if you don't do your best

454
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,319
I always do my best.

455
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:31,495
With cooking, yes.

456
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,818
Exactly!

457
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:38,449
Could you do me a favor?

458
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,320
Here,
I just need his address.

459
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:59,257
If his wife answers,
say you're an old friend

460
00:47:59,258 --> 00:48:01,988
and you forgot the address.

461
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,759
What's wrong now?

462
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:12,189
If I have to lie,
I want to know why.

463
00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:28,069
I want to send this letter
to Giuseppe.

464
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,749
Could you translate it for me?

465
00:49:05,258 --> 00:49:09,218
5 wants the crayfish
as a main course.

466
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:12,817
She won't touch anything I cook

467
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:17,048
Give her time.
- How long? Until she's...

468
00:49:18,298 --> 00:49:21,798
skin and bones?
She fainted today.

469
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:29,357
Do you like it here?

470
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,948
My mother was a vegetarian.

471
00:49:35,298 --> 00:49:38,758
Show you how to make
creme brule?

472
00:49:39,218 --> 00:49:40,970
No, thank you.

473
00:49:41,697 --> 00:49:44,797
Carry on with tables 7 and 11.

474
00:49:56,178 --> 00:49:59,908
The Steinbergs
want to speak to you.

475
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:04,050
Excuse me.

476
00:50:08,377 --> 00:50:10,107
Here, smell this.

477
00:50:12,378 --> 00:50:15,848
In Italian it's called "basilico".

478
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:21,557
You've got company now?
- Temporarily.

479
00:50:21,617 --> 00:50:23,897
And? Do you get along?

480
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:28,397
I don't know
how to deal with children.

481
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:30,728
How amusing!

482
00:50:31,057 --> 00:50:34,696
Amusing?
- The little boy in every man.

483
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:38,647
But seriously.
You prepared the angler?

484
00:50:39,577 --> 00:50:43,037
Lea, take over table 5,
will you?

485
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:08,077
This is delicious!

486
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:12,016
12 still not ready?
Get a move on!

487
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,134
Leave me some.

488
00:51:32,976 --> 00:51:36,846
I thought
I was never going to get...

489
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:47,066
Thank you.

490
00:52:27,176 --> 00:52:29,335
See you tomorrow.
- Right, tomorrow

491
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:30,769
Good night.

492
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:42,265
I hope she finds a home soon.

493
00:52:49,456 --> 00:52:51,367
She needs a home.

494
00:52:54,695 --> 00:52:58,695
Does anyone want a ride?
- Yes, please.

495
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:02,653
Take care.

496
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:32,104
Nearly finished.
First this arm...

497
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:35,372
And now this one.

498
00:54:36,135 --> 00:54:37,726
Wake up!

499
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:41,964
It's late,
we'll be late for school.

500
00:54:56,773 --> 00:54:59,573
Just tell them
it was my fault, okay?

501
00:54:59,574 --> 00:55:02,973
And that it'll never happen again.

502
00:55:02,974 --> 00:55:05,394
I'll pick you up later!

503
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:20,011
This is for you.

504
00:55:22,134 --> 00:55:25,544
Could I have
some cheese, please?

505
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:32,011
The rosemary first.
Smell.

506
00:55:33,773 --> 00:55:35,365
In she goes!

507
00:55:35,493 --> 00:55:39,353
Smells wonderful, right?
Now the fish.

508
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,332
What is it?
- Don't fall down!

509
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,244
Don't fall down!

510
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:52,683
Watch the potatoes.

511
00:56:31,813 --> 00:56:36,523
Are you crazy,
those are truffles!

512
00:56:44,452 --> 00:56:47,092
Martha! The baby's coming!

513
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,713
We need an ambulance!

514
00:56:51,733 --> 00:56:53,212
An ambulance!

515
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:08,210
Oh my God!

516
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,291
I'm sorry...
- You forgot me!

517
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,890
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

518
00:57:30,891 --> 00:57:32,371
No, I didn't

519
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:35,491
I took Lea to the hospital

520
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:38,411
We were at the market when she...

521
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:40,403
You forgot me!

522
00:57:42,652 --> 00:57:45,112
All right, I forgot you.

523
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:48,362
I'm really sorry.

524
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:51,609
Let's go home

525
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:58,882
Come, it's freezing here!

526
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:02,042
Come on, will you?

527
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:36,661
I'll make you a deal:
make a wish.

528
00:58:37,172 --> 00:58:39,331
You may wish
for anything you like,

529
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:43,130
and I'll do everything
to make it come true.

530
00:58:43,131 --> 00:58:47,311
Then forgive me
for having forgotten you.

531
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:53,281
All right, I forgive you.

532
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:55,363
Wonderful.

533
00:58:56,091 --> 00:58:59,511
I'm off to work.
Are you coming?

534
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,641
Martha?
- Yeah?

535
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:22,530
Tomorrow's your day off, right?
- Yes.

536
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:24,362
And Mario, too?

537
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:27,923
Yes, why?

538
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,089
But why can't I cook for us?

539
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:40,089
We could cook together...
- I prefer Italian food.

540
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,410
Martha, could I see you
for a moment?

541
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:45,890
What do you suggest I do?

542
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:48,769
I can't leave her at home alone,
she's only 8.

543
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,689
Exactly, she's only 8

544
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,929
She should be at home,
play with kids,

545
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:56,710
do her homework
and go to bed early.

546
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:01,230
Why don't you find her
a babysitter?

547
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:05,810
She doesn't need one,
she needs a mother.

548
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:11,260
It was Lina's idea, not mine.

549
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:16,390
Now why doesn't that
surprise me?

550
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,408
OK, all right.

551
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:26,768
And I'll do the shopping.

552
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:31,089
We've got everything.
- I do the shopping!

553
01:00:41,649 --> 01:00:43,401
He's late.

554
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,845
He's always late.

555
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:49,649
Men!

556
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:56,740
What if your letter gets lost?

557
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,490
I sent it by registered mail.

558
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:01,929
Right.

559
01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:09,849
I'll go!

560
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,130
Where's the kitchen?
- This way.

561
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:22,799
I'll take it.
- No, I've got it.

562
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:42,049
Have you got an iron pan?
- Of course.

563
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:49,259
Hands off!

564
01:01:51,568 --> 01:01:56,688
Tonight, Lina and I will do
the cooking. Just Lina and I.

565
01:01:56,689 --> 01:01:58,247
But I could...

566
01:02:14,688 --> 01:02:17,008
Why can't we eat at the table?

567
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:20,808
We haven't got a table!
We're camping!

568
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:23,328
You forgot the plates.
- No, no, no.

569
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:24,842
No plates.

570
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,808
We don't need them today.

571
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:30,588
No plates?!
- No plates!

572
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:04,467
What's wrong?
You suffer from asthma?

573
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:07,398
Allergy? Hold on.

574
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:12,708
You've got to breathe
into something,

575
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:24,118
like this. Breathe!

576
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:59,017
You've moved it!

577
01:05:23,766 --> 01:05:25,518
Good night.

578
01:05:28,286 --> 01:05:30,083
Good night.

579
01:06:09,726 --> 01:06:14,003
Napoleon's Casaro
killed himself.

580
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:18,315
He couldn't get
the mascarpone in France.

581
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:23,586
Or was it
Louis XIV's personal chef?

582
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:29,516
I can't remember.

583
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:33,495
Anyway, one of them hit the dust.

584
01:06:37,165 --> 01:06:38,644
Bit the dust.

585
01:06:42,606 --> 01:06:43,976
Bit the dust.

586
01:06:50,205 --> 01:06:53,075
Why are you telling me this?

587
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,964
Some things cannot be changed.

588
01:06:55,965 --> 01:06:58,745
No matter how hard you try.

589
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:07,315
Have you ever been to Italy?
- No.

590
01:07:08,605 --> 01:07:09,958
Why?

591
01:07:24,324 --> 01:07:26,884
Has Lina got her own room?

592
01:07:26,885 --> 01:07:28,637
Why do you ask?

593
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:33,505
We only have
her best interest at heart.

594
01:07:35,725 --> 01:07:38,005
She sleeps in my room.

595
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:42,003
Together with you?
- No, I'm on the couch.

596
01:07:42,004 --> 01:07:45,683
I see.
- It's only for the time being.

597
01:07:45,684 --> 01:07:48,004
I've been in touch
with her father...

598
01:07:48,005 --> 01:07:51,324
Her father?
I thought he was unknown.

599
01:07:51,325 --> 01:07:53,364
I've found him. He's Italian.

600
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:57,235
He'll come pick her up.
- An Italian?

601
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:02,083
And you believe
he'll come and get her?

602
01:08:02,084 --> 01:08:03,634
Yes, of course!

603
01:08:07,524 --> 01:08:10,684
Right, anyway,
this is not about

604
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:12,923
Lina being late
for school regularly.

605
01:08:12,924 --> 01:08:14,437
No?
- No

606
01:08:14,844 --> 01:08:17,403
It's about her not coming here
at all.

607
01:08:17,404 --> 01:08:21,044
And if she comes,
she falls asleep.

608
01:08:21,924 --> 01:08:25,794
And her excuse
for her lack of sleep?

609
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:30,694
That she has to work late!

610
01:08:31,084 --> 01:08:34,923
She says
she works as a kitchen help,

611
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:39,064
to earn her board
and lodgings with you!

612
01:08:40,444 --> 01:08:42,843
What did you do
the whole time?

613
01:08:42,844 --> 01:08:45,754
Nothing, I just walked round.

614
01:08:46,364 --> 01:08:49,002
You must go to school,
and that's that.

615
01:08:49,003 --> 01:08:53,373
I don't want to.
- Why not? -Just because.

616
01:08:54,604 --> 01:08:56,883
I can't take you
to the "Lido" anymore.

617
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:58,920
What? Why not?

618
01:09:00,044 --> 01:09:03,054
That isn't place for a child.

619
01:09:04,483 --> 01:09:07,903
And if I promise to go to school?

620
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:10,122
Not even then.
I just can't take you.

621
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:11,875
But why not?

622
01:09:12,003 --> 01:09:14,783
You're only 8, Lina!
- So?

623
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:18,443
You go to school
and be in bed by 8.

624
01:09:18,444 --> 01:09:20,683
You shouldn't spend
your evenings...

625
01:09:20,684 --> 01:09:23,554
You're so mean!
- Me? Mean?

626
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:26,162
You're the one telling stories!

627
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:29,602
Then I won't go to school at all!

628
01:09:29,603 --> 01:09:34,040
Want to become a foster child?
Go ahead!

629
01:09:34,123 --> 01:09:36,433
It won't be my fault!

630
01:09:36,524 --> 01:09:38,762
You don't want me anyway!

631
01:09:38,763 --> 01:09:40,481
Lina, come back!

632
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:52,598
Let me go!
I want my mommy!

633
01:09:59,003 --> 01:10:03,193
When Dad arrives
I'll get away from you!

634
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:27,073
Let me in.
- Go away! I hate you!

635
01:10:32,282 --> 01:10:34,281
That's enough, open the door!

636
01:10:34,282 --> 01:10:37,241
No! You can't order me around!

637
01:10:37,242 --> 01:10:39,041
Open the door, or I'II...

638
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:43,142
You're not my mother
and never will be!

639
01:10:43,203 --> 01:10:46,082
I don't even want to be your mother!

640
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:49,503
And I never asked to be, damn it!

641
01:11:07,482 --> 01:11:09,622
Sorry to disturb you.

642
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:12,472
Is everything okay?

643
01:11:15,402 --> 01:11:16,801
May I...?

644
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:21,081
Could you do me a favor?
- What favor?

645
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:23,400
Could you look after Lina tonight?

646
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:25,280
I know it's on very short notice,

647
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,399
but I've got to go to work.

648
01:11:30,522 --> 01:11:34,441
She probably won't
come out of her room.

649
01:11:34,442 --> 01:11:38,452
Could you look in on her
now and then?

650
01:11:38,482 --> 01:11:42,122
One more little devil
won't matter.

651
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:45,080
Thank you, that's very kind.

652
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:46,560
Goodbye

653
01:11:48,242 --> 01:11:50,631
Come on, let's play.

654
01:11:55,762 --> 01:11:59,492
Up there!
Film that, Lina, the kite!

655
01:11:59,961 --> 01:12:01,633
Stop it!

656
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:14,481
This is a serious moment.
Listen to me.

657
01:12:14,482 --> 01:12:17,400
You're not in the picture.
Now you are.

658
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:20,081
Our first holiday together!

659
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:36,029
Throw sand at her
- No!

660
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:43,191
Thanks for the tip!

661
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:25,394
Mom, I want the camera!
I want it!

662
01:15:31,759 --> 01:15:33,556
Is that her?

663
01:15:34,559 --> 01:15:38,789
At the station,
buying a ticket to Italy.

664
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,995
For 22 marks!

665
01:15:45,078 --> 01:15:49,268
Keep an eye on your niece
in the future.

666
01:16:53,597 --> 01:16:57,287
Don't ever do that again,
you hear?

667
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:11,138
I was so worried about you!

668
01:17:11,357 --> 01:17:13,427
I'm sorry.

669
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:19,634
I wish I had a recipe to follow

670
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:28,436
I know I can't replace
your mother.

671
01:17:28,437 --> 01:17:31,767
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

672
01:17:32,837 --> 01:17:36,887
I'm just doing my best,
you understand?

673
01:17:38,717 --> 01:17:42,637
I know I'm not doing
a very good job.

674
01:17:42,638 --> 01:17:46,508
But I'm trying very hard,
believe me.

675
01:17:52,637 --> 01:17:56,137
Where were you going?
To Giuseppe?

676
01:17:56,677 --> 01:18:00,457
He'll come, sweetie.
I know he will.

677
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:06,097
I'm starting to forget her.

678
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:09,677
Oh Lina, come here.

679
01:19:28,675 --> 01:19:31,595
Do you know what time it is?

680
01:19:32,996 --> 01:19:35,385
It's very, very late.

681
01:19:41,356 --> 01:19:43,586
Cognac, white wine.

682
01:19:58,836 --> 01:19:59,836
Celery.

683
01:20:02,276 --> 01:20:03,310
Leek.

684
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:12,265
Frida was raging mad,
as you can imagine.

685
01:20:18,236 --> 01:20:20,056
Onions and garlic.

686
01:20:20,755 --> 01:20:24,855
I'm sure you got along fine
without me.

687
01:20:29,315 --> 01:20:32,591
It was hell.
Open your mouth.

688
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:44,715
Basil

689
01:20:49,435 --> 01:20:50,584
Very good.

690
01:21:30,834 --> 01:21:32,472
Star-anise.

691
01:22:38,034 --> 01:22:41,124
Would you like another?
- Yes!

692
01:22:54,754 --> 01:22:57,444
Hand me the jam, will you?

693
01:22:58,993 --> 01:22:59,993
I'll go!

694
01:23:07,513 --> 01:23:09,833
Martha, could you come?

695
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:19,793
Can I help you?

696
01:23:20,713 --> 01:23:24,213
Are you Martha?
Christin's sister?

697
01:23:28,793 --> 01:23:32,753
You wrote to me.
I'm Giuseppe Lorenzo.

698
01:23:35,313 --> 01:23:36,826
Lina's father

699
01:23:48,073 --> 01:23:50,943
You'll be fine there.
- Yes

700
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:53,932
Giuseppe's very nice.

701
01:23:59,153 --> 01:24:03,293
You'll like Italy.
It's beautiful there.

702
01:24:03,673 --> 01:24:06,271
The sun nearly always shines.

703
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,592
And the food is simply delicious.

704
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,262
Have you ever been to Italy?

705
01:24:15,152 --> 01:24:19,432
No, but your Mom
always told me about it.

706
01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:21,923
Yes. Me, too.

707
01:24:46,152 --> 01:24:49,311
Your mom will always
be your mom,

708
01:24:49,312 --> 01:24:51,431
even though
she's not with you anymore.

709
01:24:51,432 --> 01:24:54,612
Always remember that,
you hear?

710
01:25:27,272 --> 01:25:28,705
Ready?

711
01:25:38,631 --> 01:25:41,951
Lina...
That's a beautiful name.

712
01:25:44,032 --> 01:25:46,722
Do you know what it means?

713
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:55,221
It's short for "Bellina".

714
01:25:56,431 --> 01:26:00,201
In Italy that means
"beautiful girl".

715
01:26:01,351 --> 01:26:03,990
That's "girl".

716
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:11,624
Beautiful girl. - Yes.

717
01:26:12,071 --> 01:26:13,629
Very good.

718
01:26:14,071 --> 01:26:17,571
Have a good trip.
Drive carefully.

719
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:20,869
Martha...

720
01:26:23,471 --> 01:26:25,142
If I'd known...

721
01:26:32,711 --> 01:26:34,491
I'm really sorry.

722
01:26:38,511 --> 01:26:40,661
I wish I'd met Lina

723
01:26:41,991 --> 01:26:44,891
under different circumstances.

724
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,464
Giuseppe...

725
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,623
Lina is...

726
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:27,065
She's a little bit like me.
You know?

727
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:29,840
A little bit.

728
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:36,501
She's not easy to get to know.

729
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,860
She likes to cook.

730
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,508
So if you...

731
01:27:52,469 --> 01:27:55,159
Lina will be fine with us.

732
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:01,100
Of course. I know.

733
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:30,759
Take care, my angel.

734
01:28:32,749 --> 01:28:34,467
You too, Martha.

735
01:29:52,389 --> 01:29:56,079
Go away, leave me alone.
I can't...

736
01:29:56,588 --> 01:29:57,987
Please.

737
01:29:59,228 --> 01:30:02,238
I told you to leave me alone!

738
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:05,378
I want you to go!

739
01:30:07,429 --> 01:30:08,748
Okay.

740
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:28,027
Table 7 wants it rare.

741
01:31:28,187 --> 01:31:29,586
It is rare.

742
01:31:29,907 --> 01:31:32,497
Obviously not rare enough.

743
01:31:33,307 --> 01:31:35,107
Any rarer and it would be raw.

744
01:31:35,108 --> 01:31:38,838
Please, not tonight.
Make a new one.

745
01:31:44,387 --> 01:31:46,626
From the asshole at table 7.

746
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:50,677
He asks:
Ever seen a really rare steak?

747
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:59,426
Rare enough?
I'll get you salt and pepper

748
01:31:59,427 --> 01:32:01,066
and you can eat it raw!

749
01:32:01,067 --> 01:32:05,027
You'll get a clean tablecloth
at once.

750
01:32:05,387 --> 01:32:07,537
No need, I'll do it.

751
01:32:14,986 --> 01:32:18,906
Now excuse me,
I've got things to do.

752
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:26,697
If you go now,
don't come back tomorrow.

753
01:32:30,146 --> 01:32:32,665
I know, but I have to go.

754
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:35,486
Take care, Frida.
Good luck

755
01:33:16,786 --> 01:33:18,583
I need your help.

756
01:33:25,106 --> 01:33:26,380
Let's go.

757
01:33:40,705 --> 01:33:44,664
Do you think she'll come back
with us?

758
01:33:44,665 --> 01:33:47,445
Of course she'll come back.

759
01:33:49,866 --> 01:33:52,065
Why would she want to stay
with her family

760
01:33:52,066 --> 01:33:54,341
in sunny Italy

761
01:33:55,386 --> 01:33:59,344
when she can go
to cold and grey Germany

762
01:33:59,345 --> 01:34:02,625
to live with a nutcase like you?

763
01:34:03,745 --> 01:34:07,255
You're so mean.
That's not funny.

764
01:34:11,106 --> 01:34:12,778
Lina loves you.

765
01:34:17,905 --> 01:34:20,005
Don't you know that?

766
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,500
Not quite.

767
01:37:22,383 --> 01:37:23,862
Not quite?

768
01:37:25,822 --> 01:37:27,734
Something's wrong.

769
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:32,262
But I made it
just the way you said.

770
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,902
I followed the recipe
step by step,

771
01:37:34,903 --> 01:37:37,593
the way you wrote it down.

772
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:41,662
Prebaked the crust
for 15 minutes?

773
01:37:41,663 --> 01:37:45,433
Exactly 15 minutes
at precisely 210C.

774
01:37:45,582 --> 01:37:50,293
You sure your oven
heats up to 210C?

775
01:37:52,063 --> 01:37:54,433
The thing is brand-new.

776
01:37:56,223 --> 01:37:59,341
Perhaps you neaded
the dough too long?

777
01:37:59,342 --> 01:38:02,932
Not a second
longer than necessary!

778
01:38:04,222 --> 01:38:06,912
Then it must be the sugar.

779
01:38:07,742 --> 01:38:08,792
The sugar?

780
01:38:10,783 --> 01:38:14,973
Did you get the Belgian
like I told you?

781
01:38:17,502 --> 01:38:20,912
Can you tell differences in sugar?

782
01:38:21,742 --> 01:38:23,202
Of course not.

783
01:38:24,742 --> 01:38:28,752
I can taste which kind
you didn't use.

784
01:38:32,463 --> 01:38:33,895
I give up.

785
01:38:34,902 --> 01:38:36,912
I'll be right back.

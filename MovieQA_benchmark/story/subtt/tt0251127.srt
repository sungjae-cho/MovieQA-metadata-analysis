1
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,815
If only you knew what I just dealt with.

2
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,943
I mean, this guy
was right in front of me going...

3
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,237
That guy deserves a ticket.
I'm sure he's still way back...

4
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,489
A woman never reveals her age.

5
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,754
"And only then
will the people of Tajikistan

6
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,047
"know true and lasting peace. "

7
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,803
Andie, it's brilliant. It's really moving.

8
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,348
But it's never gonna appear
in Composure magazine.

9
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,603
God, I busted my butt in grad school

10
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,606
to be Andie Anderson, how-to girl,

11
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,110
and write articles like,
How to Use the Best Pick-up Lines,

12
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,781
and Do Blondes, Do They, Like,
Really Have More Fun?

13
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,701
I wanna write about things that matter,
like politics

14
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,288
and the environment and foreign affairs,
things I'm interested in.

15
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,999
Keep busting your butt.
You're gonna get there.

16
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,960
Hey, I got something to cheer you up.

17
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,046
You know that editor
from Sports Illustrated

18
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,549
that you have been shamelessly
flirting with on the phone for,

19
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:18,221
I don't know, a month, now?
He made a little delivery this morning.

20
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,642
Let me see. Don't. No. Hey!

21
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,231
- Tomorrow night.
- What happens tomorrow night?

22
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,567
Only the most exhilarating
and artistic display

23
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,903
of athletic competition
known to mankind.

24
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,657
- The Ice Capades are in town?
- No, the NBA finals are in town,

25
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,409
and I got tickets!

26
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,330
- Come with me?
- All right, I'll go.

27
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,415
But I am not putting out.

28
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,668
Two stale jumbo dogs
and a couple of beers,

29
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,587
you'll be whistling a different tune.

30
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,799
- You know what I like.
- Good morning, ladies.

31
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,802
Don't forget,
staff meeting in 30 minutes.

32
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,432
Michelle. Haven't seen her all morning.
Have you?

33
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,852
- Ten-to-one she's wallowing.
- It's my turn. I'll get her.

34
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,645
You get the coffee.
Meet me on the corner in 20.

35
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,314
Wait, wait, wait.
Here, take some samples.

36
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,277
Samples. Samples. Great idea.

37
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,780
Boy, drama, drama, drama.

38
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,249
Hello, Ben.

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,836
Hey, hey. Good morning, Spears.

40
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,260
What are you reading, girl?
You catching up on your current events?

41
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,388
"Turn-on Tricks: How to Make Him Hot. "

42
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,099
You know, if you wanna try those out
sometime, we should get together.

43
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,394
Green and I have an appointment
at Composure,

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,356
the fastest-growing women's magazine
in the country.

45
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,442
And seeing as how our clients
run a lot of our campaigns

46
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,195
in their nationally syndicated
little girly magazine,

47
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,864
it wouldn't hurt you to do a little reading.

48
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,158
- Hey, Benny.
- Good morning, Green.

49
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,953
- You finally decided to show up?
- Yes, I did.

50
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,872
- You ready?
- Ready. Later, Ben.

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,376
Have a nice day, ladies.

52
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,546
Hi!

53
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,052
Good morning, sunshine.

54
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:08,265
Okay, get dressed. Get dressed.
Staff meeting, 15 minutes. Let's go.

55
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,230
I'm going back to bed.
I have no reason to live.

56
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,690
Sun's out.

57
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,276
- Okay, just...
- Okay, now.

58
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,738
Cashmere?

59
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,159
Put it on.
It'll make your eyes look fiercely green.

60
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,247
Get up. I'm not gonna let you lose
your job on top of everything else.

61
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,791
- Come here.
- Oh, Andie.

62
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,420
- Okay.
- Okay.

63
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,047
You only dated the guy a week.

64
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,425
It was the best week of my life.

65
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,760
Sweetheart.

66
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,513
Good morning, ladies!

67
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,557
- What's up, Tito?
- Warren Advertising.

68
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,518
- Yes, he's waiting for you. Hold on.
- Good morning.

69
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,646
- What's up, kitty cat?
- What's up, daddy? Big night?

70
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,648
- Not bad.
- Orgy?

71
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,984
- Where were you?
- Not at an orgy.

72
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,485
Did you hear?

73
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,363
What? That my Knickerbockers
are now in the championship series

74
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,824
and Tone the Bone, here,
owes me 20 bucks?

75
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,660
- Pay him.
- Man, well, you were right.

76
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,121
DeLauer Diamonds
is looking for a new ad agency.

77
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,165
Warren wants to move on it
aggressively.

78
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,377
Yes! Oh, this is a good day.
This is a good day.

79
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,879
Guys, did you know that diamonds

80
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,173
are about as common
as taxis on 5th Avenue?

81
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,175
The value is entirely sentimental,

82
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,763
maintained by supply,
demand and advertising.

83
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,558
Stripes. Now, DeLauer dominates
the world diamond market.

84
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,854
Meaning, if I represent them,
I basically represent the entire industry.

85
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,858
- What?
- Warren gave it to the Judys.

86
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,151
Spears and Green, they're already on it.

87
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,444
- No way!
- Yeah.

88
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,489
Well, you know, he's kind of partial
to hot, leggy chicks.

89
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,241
Yeah, and we're
the sneakers and beer division.

90
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,577
Precious gems aren't exactly our forte.

91
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,580
Lips and hips are over
at a chicks' magazine, right now.

92
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,333
- I gotta get to Warren before...
- You can't. You can't. He's on a plane.

93
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,918
Easy, pal. Chicago meeting.

94
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,045
And it's too late anyway 'cause
Warren's meeting them for drinks

95
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,505
at Mullen's tonight to discuss their idea.

96
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,924
Know what? This didn't happen.
You know why? This was my tip.

97
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,718
It's gonna be my pitch, my account,
my campaign. This is my baby.

98
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,054
- That's what I'm talking about.
- They will not ace me out of this.

99
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,680
- That's right.
- I heard that.

100
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,767
- Okay, Mullen's tonight.
- "I heard that"?

101
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,397
- Hi.
- Hi.

102
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,608
- I don't really wanna talk about it, okay?
- Okay.

103
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,818
Okay.

104
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,279
Why does this always happen to me?

105
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,241
Things are going great
for, like, a week-and-a-half

106
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,953
and then all of a sudden, it's over,
and I am mystified!

107
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:38,374
Seriously, I am mystified
because it always starts out so well.

108
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,626
- Poor baby.
- Let's just roll with this.

109
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,420
Mike and I had such a connection.

110
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,260
The first time that we had sex,
it was so beautiful.

111
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,761
I cried.

112
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,475
- You cried?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,229
You mean like one glistening tear
on your cheek, right?

114
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,567
No, I was really emotional.
I even told him that I loved him.

115
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,903
- After how many days?
- Five.

116
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,238
Two.

117
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,991
It was how I felt.
I wanted to express myself.

118
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,660
Okay. Well, what did he say?

119
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:19,248
Oh, Mike didn't have to say anything.
I know that he felt the same.

120
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,419
But then, he started getting really busy,
and I didn't know where he was,

121
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,755
so I kept calling him, calling him.
He was never home.

122
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,092
- You kept calling him?
- I didn't leave a message.

123
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,928
He didn't know it was me.
My number's blocked.

124
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,848
Oh, I'm sure he thought
it was one of his friends.

125
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,017
You know, men frequently
call their friends' answering machines

126
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,518
and hang up 20 times.

127
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:43,230
Anyway, I know why he dumped me.

128
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,858
I'm too fat.

129
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,110
- You're not fat!
- You're not fat!

130
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,698
Michelle, if the most beautiful woman
in the world acted the way you did,

131
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,618
any normal guy would still go running
in the other direction.

132
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,871
No. No guy would go running
from you, Andie.

133
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,791
You could barf all over him
and he would say, "Do it again. "

134
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,128
That is both incredibly disgusting
and categorically untrue.

135
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,923
If I did the things you did,
I'd get dumped, too.

136
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,469
Okay, family, shoes off.

137
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,474
And breathe.

138
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,436
Out.

139
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,273
Okay, Lori, let's start with you.

140
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,651
Well, the BOTOX for Beginners piece
is done.

141
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,445
Now, it's a little scary,
but mostly upbeat.

142
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,072
Now I'm on
What Your Gyno Won't Tell You,

143
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,158
which is also pretty scary,
but, you know, upbeat.

144
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,410
I finished my research
on Deadly Pedicures,

145
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,248
about the woman who contracted
that fungus from the unsterilized tools.

146
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,961
It's a terrible story,
although surprisingly upbeat.

147
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,171
- Upbeat.
- Marvelous.

148
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,633
What's next for How-To With Andie?

149
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,679
Well, I've been working on something
that's, kind of, different.

150
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,723
- It's... It's a political piece and it's...
- No.

151
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,643
Andie, you work
at Composure magazine.

152
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,521
We are fashion, trends, diets,
cosmetic surgeries,

153
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,190
salacious gossip, that's Composure.

154
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,859
- Okay, but...
- Look, Andie. Okay.

155
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,736
The column is new for you.

156
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,446
When you turn it into a must-read,

157
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,824
then you can write about
whatever you want.

158
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,369
Until then, you can write about
whatever I want.

159
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,413
- Understood?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,541
Michelle, what have you got?

161
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,254
I'm sorry, Lana.
I wasn't feeling very well.

162
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,675
- She got dumped.
- Oh, no, Michelle!

163
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,177
What a hellish ordeal for you.

164
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,972
But I must say,
you are looking fabulous.

165
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,683
Are we loving the way she looks, all?

166
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,060
- We love the way she looks.
- Oh, you're so right. She looks great.

167
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:49,982
- I haven't eaten since the split.
- Good for you! Write about it.

168
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,401
I can't use my personal life for a story.

169
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,570
I understand completely.

170
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,948
Who will use Michelle's personal life
for a story?

171
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,742
- Oh, I will!
- Go.

172
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,661
No, no, no! Lana, with all due respect,

173
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,832
Lori has no business mucking around
in my personal life, and I can't let her.

174
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,168
- I'll do it.
- What?

175
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,962
I'll sort of do it. It's...

176
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,881
You will be my inspiration.

177
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,675
- For?
- Look at Michelle.

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,721
- She is a great girl, right?
- Yes.

179
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,639
An amazing woman.

180
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,977
But she has a problem
hanging on to relationships,

181
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,271
and doesn't really know
what's she doing wrong,

182
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,732
which is like a lot of our readers.

183
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:37,571
So I was thinking that I could start
by dating a guy

184
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,947
and then drive him away,

185
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,660
but only using the classic mistakes
most women, like Michelle,

186
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,080
make all the time.

187
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,125
I'll keep a diary of it

188
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,964
and it will be sort of
a dating how-to in reverse.

189
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,010
- What not to do.
- Yeah.

190
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,680
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

191
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,350
Yes. Go.

192
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,229
- Bart, what's new in the shoe...
- Wait, wait, Lana. I'm sorry.

193
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,480
Why 10 days?

194
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,650
Five days is too short,
and we go to press in 11. Yes?

195
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,237
Okay, what we found out
is men are attracted to purple shoes.

196
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,448
- Thank you.
- Now, I love them myself...

197
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,243
Maybe toss in something spiritual
as well.

198
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,121
Who's that chic Buddhist
Richard Gere cavorts with?

199
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,331
- The Dalai Lama?
- He's fabulous.

200
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,334
- Here's my 10:00. Welcome.
- Hi.

201
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,296
Ladies, Judy Spears and Judy Green
from Warren Advertising.

202
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,508
We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins for the fall.

203
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,804
Jeannie Ashcroft, fashion and trends.
Michelle Rubin, fitness and health.

204
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,139
Excuse me. Hi.

205
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,391
And Andie Anderson,
our resident how-to girl.

206
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,602
Oh, I've seen your column, Andie.
What are you working on now?

207
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,148
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

208
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,150
She's actually going to
start dating a guy

209
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,694
and then drive him away
in a week-and-a-half.

210
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,780
Sounds needlessly vicious.

211
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,615
It's going to be fabulous.

212
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,285
Now, all she has to do is run along
and find the lucky guy.

213
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,786
- Go, go, go.
- Nice to meet you.

214
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,788
Ladies, come.

215
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,374
Find the guy. Find the guy.

216
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,794
You are never going to pull this off.

217
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,965
Watch me. Tonight, I'll hook a guy.
Tomorrow, pull the switch.

218
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,175
Before the 10 days are up,

219
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,177
I'm gonna have this guy
running for his life.

220
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,513
You're not gonna burn his apartment
down or bite him or anything, are you?

221
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,515
No, I'm gonna limit myself

222
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,268
to doing everything girls do wrong
in relationships.

223
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,520
Basically,
everything we know guys hate.

224
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,148
I'll be clingy, needy.

225
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,774
- Be touchy-feely.
- Yeah.

226
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,359
Call him in the middle of the night

227
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,403
and tell him everything
you had to eat that day.

228
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,405
What's wrong with that?

229
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,616
I'm kidding.

230
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,879
Hello, Ben.

231
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,174
- What are you doing here?
- Phil, I'm here for the meeting. Ladies.

232
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,177
- But, you weren't invited.
- Yeah, but I should have been.

233
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,429
I mean, it was my tip that DeLauer
was shopping for a new firm.

234
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,599
Yes, it was, but I have to think
in terms of who's best suited

235
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,892
within the company team.

236
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,645
Yes, sir, and that's me.
I wanna handle this pitch.

237
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,814
Ben, you sell Joe Blow
better than anyone else in my shop,

238
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,985
but these girls sell luxury
better than anyone else in the business.

239
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,113
We have to put our best foot forward
on this pitch.

240
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,824
- DeLauer would be our biggest account.
- Yes, sir, they would.

241
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,370
Annual advertising billings
of 50 to 60 million dollars,

242
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,248
and I am the man that's gonna
bring this home for you, Phil.

243
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,708
- Why this place?
- Because it's perfect.

244
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,085
- Hi, Ingrid.
- Hi.

245
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,340
Mullen's is the après-work watering hole
for the upwardly mobile.

246
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,468
Now, to date, the diamond industry
has always targeted men,

247
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,180
sending the message that the woman
needs the man to buy her the rock.

248
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,516
All right, they say,
"A diamond is forever. "

249
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,185
We say, "A diamond is for everyone. "

250
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,562
- I like that.
- Yes.

251
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,815
We don't. "A diamond is for everyone"

252
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,943
sends the message
that diamonds are everywhere,

253
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,862
which means they're not rare,
and if they're not rare,

254
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,614
they lose their status.

255
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,492
Status is the reason to buy them
in the first place,

256
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,161
which Benjamin would know
if he understood women,

257
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,913
which you don't.

258
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,918
You can't feel bad about that, Ben.
No man does.

259
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,837
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

260
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,256
Sorry.

261
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,594
- Here. Here.
- Thanks.

262
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,557
Hey, don't pressure her. She's perusing.

263
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,183
Yes, exactly.

264
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,356
Selling a diamond to a woman
is like making her fall in love.

265
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:46,903
She has to feel giddy, desirous,
adventurous and desperate.

266
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,156
Take a look around this room, Phillip.

267
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,908
Most of the women in this bar
are looking for just that.

268
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,494
Exactly. The skills required
to market diamonds

269
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,372
are the same as those needed
to make a woman fall in love, yes.

270
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,084
I'm not talking about lust.
A woman in lust wants chocolate.

271
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,046
A woman in love wants diamonds.

272
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,716
Yeah, I'm not talking
about lust either, ladies.

273
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,471
I'm talking about deep, meaningful,
head-over-heels, his-and-her towels,

274
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,350
let's grow old together L-O-V-E.

275
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,436
Look, I love women.

276
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:24,399
I do. Whether they're 4 or 40
or my 88-year-old grandmother,

277
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,276
I respect women, all right?

278
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,529
And I also listen to women.

279
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:34,660
And that's why I can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, anytime.

280
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:39,414
Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, Benjamin, or with you?

281
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,667
Either one.

282
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,128
- That's cocky, Ben.
- No, not cocky. Confident.

283
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,133
- I'd like to see you prove that.
- You would?

284
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,554
The agency is co-hosting a party
for the DeLauers at the Astor Museum.

285
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,390
The party's a week from Sunday.

286
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,559
Do you think you can make a woman
fall in love with you by then?

287
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,271
- Ten days.
- Any woman, anywhere, anytime.

288
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,025
Any single, available,
straight woman, yes.

289
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,196
Yes. I'm not trying to trick you, Ben.
In fact,

290
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,075
we'll choose a woman right here,
right now, in this bar,

291
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,660
and then you decide.

292
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,123
- So who's the lucky girl?
- Okay.

293
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's see here.

294
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,753
There's that blonde babe
in the leopard print.

295
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,381
- She looks like fun.
- Be nice, ladies.

296
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:34,302
Or, wow, Miss Babylon 5.
Now she's on the prowl.

297
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,513
No.

298
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,098
Her.

299
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,308
- Her who?
- Her in the gray dress.

300
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,811
Blonde hair, pretty smile.

301
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,233
Her?

302
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,533
- Done.
- What?

303
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,704
- Done.
- Done.

304
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,875
See the guy next to the horrible guy
in the green shirt

305
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,460
that I would never even consider?

306
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,295
- Okay?
- Very cute.

307
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,589
- Right?
- Good.

308
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,174
Here I go.

309
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,178
Okay, you're on.

310
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,513
But here are the stakes.

311
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,892
- After I win this bet, this pitch is mine.
- Agreed.

312
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,769
- Phil?
- Agreed.

313
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,898
You come to that party with a girl
that's really in love with you, Ben,

314
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,192
you can make the pitch to the DeLauers.

315
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,236
- But, Phillip, you can't...
- I've made up my mind.

316
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,032
- To the DeLauers.
- To the DeLauers.

317
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,034
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

318
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,247
I was just wondering if you find...

319
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,793
Exciting.

320
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,172
Yes, my wife and I love New York,
especially this time of year.

321
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,383
- She'd been here before and I...
- Hi.

322
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,760
- Hi.
- This is Andie.

323
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,094
Hi.

324
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,556
- You guys enjoy New York.
- Okay.

325
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,226
- Thanks, we will.
- Nice meeting you.

326
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,774
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Phil.

327
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,569
Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies,
I have a bet to win.

328
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,155
Ta-ta.

329
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,038
Now do you wanna tell me
what's going on?

330
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,040
You don't recognize her?

331
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,173
Hi!

332
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,883
- Hi.
- Hi.

333
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,515
- Andie Anderson.
- Benjamin Barry.

334
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,475
- Cute.
- Thank you.

335
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,852
I meant your name.

336
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,105
Thank you two times.

337
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,732
- Unattached?
- Currently.

338
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,278
- Likewise.
- Surprising.

339
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,780
- Psycho?
- Rarely.

340
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,577
- Interested?
- Perhaps.

341
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,247
- Hungry?
- Starving.

342
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,583
- Leaving.
- Now?

343
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,544
- Okay.
- Okay.

344
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,547
- One second.
- I'll meet you at the door.

345
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,300
Hey, hey, guys.

346
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,844
- What?
- I think I got one.

347
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,346
- He was married.
- No, not him.

348
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,683
It's the guy by the door.
But don't look! No, guys!

349
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,479
He is really cute.

350
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,565
I'm gonna check this one out
and see if he's the keeper.

351
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,609
- Okay.
- And if he is?

352
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,028
Tomorrow night I'll...

353
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,863
Flip the switch.

354
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,034
- I'm doing this for you.
- Well, good luck. Be safe.

355
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,535
Call me!

356
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,830
Drama, drama, drama.

357
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,552
No, no, no. This one.

358
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,735
And you get to wear
the goofy-looking helmet.

359
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:25,492
- It's not gonna look goofy on me.
- It looks goofy on just about everybody.

360
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,703
Look at you. That's pretty damn cute.

361
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,792
There you go.

362
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:46,429
- You ready to go for a ride, Andie?
- Are you ready to go for a ride, Ben?

363
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,735
- Get it. Get it?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,698
- So what do you think?
- About the food or you?

365
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,074
Both.

366
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,785
This is delicious.

367
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,538
And I'm still deciding.

368
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,039
Anything I can do to help?

369
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,875
Yeah, you can answer some questions
for me, actually.

370
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,504
"Some" sounds a little too indefinite.
I'll give you three.

371
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,007
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm in advertising.

372
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,176
I work mostly with alcoholic beverage
and athletic equipment companies,

373
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,430
and I'm trying to break into
the jewelry market right now.

374
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,183
Saving the world
one keg party at a time?

375
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,436
Yeah, something like that.

376
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,609
- What about you?
- What about me?

377
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,655
- Have I seen your work?
- I work at Composure.

378
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,034
Fastest-growing women's
fashion magazine in the country.

379
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,368
I'm impressed.

380
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,413
Saving the world
one shopaholic at a time?

381
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,709
Hey, all right. Look here, Sparky.

382
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,920
I have a masters in journalism
from Columbia.

383
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,215
My boss loves me,
and if I do it her way for a while,

384
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,760
I can write about anything I want.

385
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,261
Like shoes?

386
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,096
No.

387
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,806
No.

388
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,561
Like alcoholic beverages
and athletic gear.

389
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,023
Touché. Very nice.

390
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,277
- So you think you got me all figured out?
- Almost.

391
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,698
- I still got one last question.
- Shoot.

392
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,868
True or false?

393
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,415
All's fair in love and war.

394
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,420
True.

395
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,468
- Great answer.
- Good question.

396
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,055
Welcome.

397
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,061
- Oh, nice place.
- Thank you.

398
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,521
Very tidy.

399
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,109
- Can I get you a cold beer?
- Sure.

400
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,486
- Can I use your restroom?
- Yeah, you can.

401
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,364
It's up the stairs through the bedroom.

402
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,495
You are, aren't you?
The first night. I can't believe you.

403
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,789
Michelle,
I'm not going to sleep with him.

404
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,042
Oh, you are such a hussy.
You can't hide those lying eyes.

405
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:25,046
No, no, because
I can practice some self-control,

406
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,632
- unlike some people I know.
- Oh, really? That hurts, kind of.

407
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,144
- I'm gonna dangle the bait.
- Wait. What's the bait?

408
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,521
- I'm the bait, Michelle.
- Oh.

409
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,274
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm with you. Then what?

410
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,783
A diamond is no one-night stand.

411
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,586
A diamond is a long-term commitment.

412
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,256
- Takes notes. You better record...
- I can't talk right now. I have to go.

413
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,925
- Call me later, you slut.
- Okay, bye.

414
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,439
- There you go.
- Thank you.

415
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,857
You're welcome.

416
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,646
Okay.

417
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,926
Hey, hey, let's not go too fast, okay?

418
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,847
Yeah.

419
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,599
Yeah.

420
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,781
We're moving too fast.

421
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,785
You're right. It's too fast.

422
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,664
Okay.

423
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,055
- Too fast.
- Too fast.

424
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,974
Yeah.

425
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:26,060
I want you to respect me.

426
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,897
- I do.
- Okay.

427
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,234
And I want your respect.

428
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,070
I respect you for respecting me.

429
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,323
I respect that.

430
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,867
Good.

431
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,005
Good night, Andie Anderson.

432
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,347
Oh, you are already
falling in love with me.

433
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,183
I'm gonna make you wish
you were dead.

434
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,269
Poor guy.

435
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,531
Of all the women Spears and Green
could have thrown at me,

436
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,450
this one is amazing.

437
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,620
Hanging with her for 10 days
is gonna be no problem.

438
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,538
Right. That's only nine days longer

439
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,374
than you've ever spent
with any other chick, huh?

440
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,042
That's why I didn't
go for the gold immediately.

441
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,712
I'm taking my time.
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

442
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,964
Ten days is a marathon?

443
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,217
Okay, so it's more like
the 3,000 meter hurdles.

444
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,469
The point is,
she's already on the ropes, guys.

445
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,305
Wow, that's a lot of sports analogy.

446
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,641
- Is that it?
- That's it.

447
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,976
- Have you looked inside?
- No.

448
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:52,063
Do you have an ethical problem
with rifling through a woman's purse?

449
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,731
Yeah, I guess I do.

450
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,818
Well, it's hardly a purse, dude.
It's more like a clutch or something.

451
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:01,072
Guys, a woman's purse, all right,
it's her secret source of power.

452
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,158
All right, there are many dark
and dangerous things in there

453
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,829
that we, the male species,
should know nothing about.

454
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,998
Unless, of course,
she left it behind intentionally

455
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,459
to secure a next-day call back.

456
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,337
She's a very clever minx.

457
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,508
- I'm sorry! Oh, God!
- We gotta clean that up.

458
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,427
Yeah, yeah.

459
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,471
Carefully. Carefully.

460
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,267
Oh, what have we here?

461
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,019
Let us see. Let us see.

462
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
Knicks tickets.

463
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,526
For tonight's game.

464
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,822
- Delivery, Andie.
- Wow, look at those!

465
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,200
Andie! Oh, my God.

466
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,703
Where do you want these?

467
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:49,871
Wait.

468
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:54,959
"One hundred times more beautiful... "

469
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,377
Wait.

470
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,880
"... than 100 roses. "

471
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,799
- Catchy.
- The guy's in advertising.

472
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:05,636
- He can't help it.
- So does this mean he's hooked?

473
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,972
This means he found the Knicks tickets.

474
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,225
- You left the tickets in the purse?
- Yeah.

475
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,562
You are just
on a whole different playing field.

476
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,731
Here you go.

477
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,901
Andie Anderson.

478
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,237
- Hey, hey, pretty girl.
- Guess what?

479
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,491
I got a really embarrassing display
of white roses.

480
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,577
Well, you are welcome. Listen,
I had a wonderful time last night.

481
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:33,498
- I have your bag.
- I know.

482
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,000
I can't believe I left it there.

483
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:41,839
Well, you must need it back,
what with all the cash, credit cards

484
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,592
and those Knicks tickets
for tonight's game.

485
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,345
Sounds like you've been peeking
through my bag, Ben.

486
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,513
Oh, absolutely not.

487
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:52,683
Tony, my art director, he's an oaf,
and he accidentally knocked it over.

488
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,810
Right. Yeah, I'm a clumsy man.

489
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,438
All right. I'm sorry, though.

490
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,690
I'm going to the game
with somebody else.

491
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,192
Not anymore.

492
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,195
Besides, what, you think you left
your purse at my place by accident?

493
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,780
No, subconsciously, you are dying

494
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,281
to take me to that game.

495
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,367
Denying your subconscious desires

496
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,786
is extremely dangerous to your health,
young lady.

497
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,871
Does that psychobabble
really work on anybody?

498
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,540
You tell me.

499
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,960
Andie, you're so bad.

500
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,215
All right, meet me
at the 7th Avenue entrance.

501
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,051
-7:30. Don't be late.
- You got it.

502
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,886
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

503
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,725
- And that's how it's done.
- And that's how it's done.

504
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,609
Foul on number 20, Allan Houston.

505
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,488
- Bullshit! Come on, ref!
- What is that, ref?

506
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,658
Hey, if you're going to call it,
call it both ways.

507
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,743
Oh, you're soft, man!

508
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:56,330
You were soft last year,
and you're still soft!

509
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,624
What was that?

510
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,258
There we go. Work it around.

511
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,681
Defense!

512
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,434
- Defense!
- Come on, buddy.

513
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,852
Defense!

514
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,104
Defense!

515
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,690
Defense!

516
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,275
Knicks call a 20-second timeout.

517
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,694
All right, take your five.
Take your minute.

518
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:32,700
This is all right. We got 20 seconds.
A 20-second T.

519
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,526
Knicks ball.

520
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,489
Bring it back!

521
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,532
Charge!

522
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,577
Work your arm, baby.

523
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,747
- Charge!
- Go, baby.

524
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,333
- Hold 'em up!
- Charge!

525
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,834
- Benny.
- What? What? Yeah?

526
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,920
Benny, I'm thirsty.

527
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,089
- Yeah, yeah!
- Benny, can you go get me a soda?

528
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,091
- Yeah, I just wanna tell you, right now...
- I'm parched.

529
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,509
...there's a minute, nine left
in the game,

530
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,844
- and then I'll go up and get it.
- I'm really thirsty.

531
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,347
- I'll go get it.
- Hang on.

532
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,183
- You want it right now?
- Yeah.

533
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,103
Okay, no ice, Ben. Thanks, Benny.

534
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,272
Lawrence Funderburke!

535
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,529
Here's Sprewell with the fake.
Gets the step on Christie.

536
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,198
- What a crossover!
- My man, Coke, no ice.

537
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,033
- Next line over, pal.
- No ice.

538
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,954
Hey, buddy. Small Coke, no ice.
Small Coke, no ice.

539
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,872
Okay, you got it.

540
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,958
Just beyond the three-point line. Fires!

541
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,294
- No! Man, don't let him have that shot!
- Does that mean no, you don't want ice,

542
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,381
- or no, you want ice?
- No. No, no ice. Coke, no ice.

543
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,967
Don Chaney wants to talk it over.

544
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,803
- Did you want a small?
- No, I want that one, right there.

545
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,639
You know, for 25 cents more,
you could get a jumbo.

546
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,642
You take that right there.
Keep the change.

547
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,397
Charge!

548
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,153
Excuse me.

549
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,410
Come on, baby, drive in the net!

550
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,745
Thanks.

551
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,665
Hey, hold him, hold him. Move it.
Set your pick!

552
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,003
- Watch the three seconds! Traveling!
- Ben, it's not diet. Ben, it's not diet.

553
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,505
Please, I'm so thirsty.

554
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,342
- With a lime. With a lime.
- All right, all right.

555
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,852
Shoot it!

556
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,314
Sprewell for the win. Yes!

557
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,526
Latrell Sprewell!

558
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,698
It's all over. The Knicks have defeated
the Kings in the final seconds.

559
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,452
Latrell Sprewell
with the game-winning shot.

560
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,873
And the Knicks over Sacramento 97-96.

561
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,960
What an incredible game!

562
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,798
I've never seen a more exciting game
played before.

563
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,634
Wow. You know, neither have I.

564
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,054
Hey, hey, hey. It's too bad you missed it.

565
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,016
- Yeah, it's too bad.
- One second.

566
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:50,189
So, are you as nice as you seem, Ben?

567
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,485
No.

568
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,740
Good, neither am I.

569
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,158
Oh, here.

570
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,871
Fifth and Twelfth, please. See you later.

571
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,421
Horseshit!

572
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,090
More horseshit.

573
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,177
The horseshit continues. Horseshit.

574
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,846
Come on, people.

575
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,348
We gotta do a lot better than this
if we're gonna...

576
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,768
- What?
- There's a phone call for Mr. Barry.

577
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,564
- Yeah, can you take a message, Candi?
- Mr. Barry, it's Andie.

578
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,860
- Make it quick.
- I will.

579
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,237
- It's line two, Mr. Barry.
- Thank you.

580
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,286
- Hello.
- It's me!

581
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,539
Listen, I'm in the middle of a meeting.
Can I call you back in just a minute?

582
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:52,626
I miss you,
Benny Boo-Boo Boo-Boo-Boo.

583
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,462
Well, you know what, I miss you, too.

584
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,131
You busy tonight?

585
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,466
No. No, I'm not.

586
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,051
Why don't we catch a movie
or something?

587
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,721
- A movie? My choice?
- Your choice.

588
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,975
Oh, I'm so excited!
Okay, I'll call you later.

589
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,643
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

590
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:16,817
Jonah!

591
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,113
I always wanted a man like Tom Hanks.

592
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,828
- It's my favorite movie of all time.
- Yeah, me, too.

593
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,415
What if something
had happened to you?

594
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,500
What if I couldn't get to you?

595
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:38,255
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing. I'm watching the movie.

596
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,133
Yeah, but what's on your mind?

597
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,678
I like this movie.

598
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,348
Oh, so I suppose
your mind is a complete blank?

599
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,351
You are my family. You're all I've got.

600
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,852
Who is she?

601
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,273
- Who's who?
- The girl you're thinking about.

602
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,360
- Can't hear.
- I'm not thinking about a girl.

603
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,113
You can't watch Meg Ryan for two hours
and not be thinking about another girl.

604
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,657
Lady, shut up.

605
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,451
Wanna know what I'm thinking about?

606
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,203
Yes.

607
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,958
I'm sitting here thinking about
how damn beautiful you are.

608
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,209
That's what I'm thinking about.

609
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,962
Come here.
Let's watch this movie. It's good.

610
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,676
Benji.

611
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,473
Oh, sweetie.

612
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,643
- I love sharing this with you.
- Yeah.

613
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,978
Can't hear and can't see.

614
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,064
If you don't shut up,
my boyfriend over here

615
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,650
is gonna come back there
and pummel your ass.

616
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,486
Put a muzzle on your old lady
the next time you bring her out in public!

617
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,990
- What? What is that? Do something...
- You, outside!

618
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,244
Keep it down.

619
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,162
Have a little class, all right?

620
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,164
You wanna talk like that to me,
we can work it out,

621
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,167
- but not to a lady, all right?
- Ben, Ben, he's huge.

622
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,753
I got it. I'm not looking
to get into a fight with the guy, okay?

623
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,006
He owes you an apology.

624
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:09,263
Now I'm gonna go back inside and
finish watching Sleepless in Seattle.

625
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,516
- Nobody screw with me.
- Son of a bitch.

626
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,936
Oh, Ben, are you okay?

627
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,439
Ben, Ben,
maybe we should get you to a hospital.

628
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,441
- No, no, no.
- No, you could have a...

629
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,942
Excuse me?

630
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,861
Hey, can you hold still?
Right there. Hold still.

631
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,612
Okay, I'm sorry.

632
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,451
Yeah. That's feeling real nice.
It's starting to feel a little better.

633
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,078
Ben. Ben.

634
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:38,167
Ben! Oh, my God! You're fine.

635
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,295
You are totally fine.

636
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,674
Okay, come on, Rocky. Get up.

637
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,554
- Huh?
- Yeah.

638
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,097
Hey, don't feel bad.

639
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,809
If I had a nickel for every time
I got in a fistfight during a chick flick...

640
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,103
- Right. It really wasn't that bad.
- Really?

641
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,731
No, I mean, the getting punched
in the face part sucked, right?

642
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,901
The getting taken care of
after the punch, it was nice.

643
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,320
Florence Nightingale syndrome.

644
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,990
You want me to tape
the game for you, tonight?

645
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,077
No need, my friend.
I'll be watching the Knicks

646
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,621
in the comfort of my own home,
this evening.

647
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,539
How'd you swing that?

648
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,125
What's the coup de grâce?
Heavyweight.

649
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,419
- You're making the lamb.
- Voilà.

650
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,379
A woman loves a man who can cook.
Yeah?

651
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,631
Bringing out the big guns.

652
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,132
- Let's go deep.
- I like it.

653
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,718
Why do they always forget my bacon?

654
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,346
I can't believe
you got that guy knocked out.

655
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,598
Only for a few seconds.

656
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:39,394
He was the most adorable
unconscious man, ever.

657
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:44,066
Are you dating him,
or are you contemplating adoption?

658
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,529
Andie, I am loving your notes
on this piece.

659
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,449
Thank you, Lana.

660
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,160
- When are you seeing him again?
- Tonight.

661
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,205
He's invited me over for dinner.

662
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,959
Marvelous.
I've got a feeling about this one.

663
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,961
Thanks, Lana.

664
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,921
I hate it
when she pops her head in like that.

665
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,715
- I never...
- I heard that.

666
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:12,052
And, Andie, tonight, take smaller bites.

667
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:20,185
- Oh, my God.
- Disgusting. I can barely eat over here.

668
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,900
Come on in. Door's open.

669
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,488
- Hi!
- Hey there.

670
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,368
I hope you brought your appetite, girl.
We've got a feast tonight.

671
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,918
Benny, isn't that sweet.

672
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,754
Go ahead and pour yourself
a glass of wine.

673
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,758
We got dinner in about five
and tipoff in about eight.

674
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,052
Great. I'm starving.

675
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:10,944
Oh, so perfectly pink!

676
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:36,303
Sheryl, Tori, Sinead,
Jewel, Fiona, Carly.

677
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:40,140
- The gang's all here!
- Great!

678
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,477
We got two minutes to game time.

679
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:47,064
You walked into the party

680
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:51,235
Like you were walking onto a yacht

681
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,782
Your hat strategically dipped
below one eye

682
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,910
Your scarf it was apricot

683
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,871
Wow! Look at all this stuff.

684
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:09,169
Those are cute,
and I saw the new comforter.

685
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,882
And all the girls dreamed that
they'd be Ben's partner

686
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,219
They'd be Ben's partner

687
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,555
- What you got in the box?
- Oh.

688
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,143
- It's a baby fern.
- Really?

689
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,896
- Oh, yeah?
- Just like our relationship,

690
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:31,942
a helpless little baby
in need of tender, loving care.

691
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,238
Thank you.

692
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,157
Sit down.

693
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,745
Have a seat. Get ready.

694
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,792
Game two.
Welcome to the front row, madame.

695
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,169
Oh, oh. Up here.

696
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,174
Dinner is served.

697
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:00,178
Chef's special tonight,
lamb with a cherry glaze.

698
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:04,433
Let's start you off with the main dish.

699
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:08,186
Right about there. And a few carrots.

700
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,858
Wait, wait. Hey. Hey. You okay?

701
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,485
It's beautiful.

702
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,198
- Thanks.
- You're beautiful,

703
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,409
the game, the whole thing.

704
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,580
I wish I ate meat.

705
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:34,671
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb

706
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,801
You have to take it away before I gag.

707
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,181
This stuff's for cows.

708
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,355
- Hi.
- Hi.

709
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:55,400
- How you doing?
- Just a little indigestion.

710
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,069
Are you okay?

711
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,654
All right. Excuse me, ma'am.

712
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,366
You happen to know the score
of the Knicks game?

713
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,286
Do I look like the kind of person
who knows the score of a Knicks game?

714
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:07,913
No, you don't.

715
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,210
Is something wrong with the barley?

716
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,420
No, no.

717
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,387
My boyfriend thinks I'm fat!

718
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,767
And I can't eat in front of him.

719
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,061
I can't eat in front of you!

720
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,731
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I don't think you're fat.

721
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,195
I don't think she's fat.

722
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,332
- What's happening?
- Sprewell just tied it up.

723
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,293
- Twenty-three seconds left, Knicks ball.
- ... Allan Houston with the ball.

724
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,129
Oh, come on!

725
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,047
There it is. There it is.

726
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,509
That was in! Come on. Get it back.

727
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,348
Get the ball back! Get the ball back!

728
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,475
A spin by Jackson.

729
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,602
- No!
- Jackson able to hit,

730
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,271
and the game has run out.

731
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,691
The Kings have beat the Knicks.
Their first win of the series.

732
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,276
It's 97-95, Sacramento.

733
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,402
Next game.

734
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,619
Well, that was fun.

735
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:35,333
Okay, 11:25 sports. There we are.

736
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:36,918
...cut it to ten.

737
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,505
It's Mark Jackson
with a no-look pass to Kurt Thomas.

738
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,049
- Sorry we missed the game.
- Post. Post.

739
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,010
Reverse!

740
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,306
- There we go, baby.
- I can't believe he missed that shot.

741
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,476
Take it! Take it! Hit it!

742
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,060
No!

743
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,439
How the hell did you know
he was gonna miss that shot?

744
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:01,651
He always misses the shot
from the top of the key.

745
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,488
That's the way it ended as the Knicks
could not get off another shot.

746
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,200
Oh, man.

747
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:13,580
Houston never misses
from the top of the key.

748
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,802
Does Princess Sophia
wanna come out and play?

749
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,972
Who's Princess Sophia?

750
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:39,105
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Wait, wait. You're kidding me, right?

751
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,441
- Princess Sophia?
- Little, big. Little, big.

752
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,902
I don't know. We will find out.

753
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,905
You know, hang on a second.

754
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:52,410
All right, listen, you can't name
my member Princess Sophia.

755
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,329
- It doesn't...
- Yes, I can.

756
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:58,208
Listen to me. If you're gonna
name my member, all right,

757
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,794
you gotta name it
something hyper-masculine, okay?

758
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,462
Something like Spike or Butch

759
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,048
or Krull, the Warrior King,
but not Princess Sophia.

760
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,758
What did you just say?

761
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,262
Spike. You know what I mean?

762
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:13,139
- No, no, after Spike.
- Butch.

763
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,849
After Butch.

764
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,438
Krull, the Warrior King.

765
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:25,485
Does Krull, the Warrior King
want to come out and play?

766
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,740
- No.
- Come on out of there.

767
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,868
- Krull!
- You know what?

768
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,664
Due to intense humiliation,

769
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:42,544
the king has momentarily
abdicated his throne, okay?

770
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,923
- Yeah.
- Well, in that case,

771
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,135
I better get going.

772
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,308
Take care of our love fern, honey.

773
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,452
Hi.

774
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,872
Can I see you tomorrow?

775
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,249
- Really?
- I hope so.

776
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,836
- Call me.
- I will.

777
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,963
- And I'll call you.
- Sweet dreams.

778
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,715
Answer your phone!

779
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,717
What?

780
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,428
What was "icy" again?

781
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,430
"Arctic, freezing, frigid. "

782
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,226
- How about "glitter"?
- Thayer's favorite movie.

783
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,978
It was underrated.

784
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,065
"Glint, glisten, scintillation. "

785
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,526
- Scintillation, that's not bad.
- That sucks.

786
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:52,781
Guys, let's take a break.
A little coffee and nine ball. Shake it up.

787
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:57,494
Maybe I'll be able to concentrate
since the woman is driving me crazy.

788
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,538
Which woman,
Andie or Princess Sophia?

789
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wait a second. I thought you said,

790
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,002
after the Knicks game,
that she was a goddess.

791
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,463
Oh, she was.
That was the good Andie, guys.

792
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,841
This amazing, fun, cool, sexy woman.

793
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,677
I'm talking about the evil Andie now.

794
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:17,222
It's like a crack-enhanced
Kathie Lee Gifford.

795
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,140
She's probably bipolar.

796
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,685
Well, her south pole's
definitely prevailing.

797
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:25,105
Well, all you gotta do
is rock it for five more days.

798
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,108
- Muffin!
- Which shouldn't be too difficult.

799
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,943
- Hi.
- Andie, my sweetie.

800
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,695
We were just talking about you.

801
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,530
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

802
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,699
- How are you? You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

803
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,284
- This is Tony and this is Thayer.
- Oh, yes.

804
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,620
Benny-Wenny's told me
so much about you two.

805
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,290
Oh, well, Benny-Wenny
said wonderful things about you, too.

806
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,127
Oh, they don't look so simpleminded.

807
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,629
Honey, look what I got for us.

808
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,551
Look at that. Come on. Come on.

809
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,971
- Wow!
- Look at him go. What is it?

810
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,474
It's a Chinese Crested, of course.

811
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,227
No kidding. A Chinese Crested.

812
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,479
So, it's like a dog, right?

813
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,733
- Whoa! There he is.
- Ben. Ben.

814
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,401
You're hurting Krull's feelings.

815
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,738
- Krull, is it?
- Krull. Krull, the Warrior king.

816
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,906
Well, sure, 'cause that's clearly what...

817
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,159
Oh, wait. There's more.

818
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:20,994
- What do you got there?
- Oh, nice.

819
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,663
- For me? Get out of town.
- Try it on.

820
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,166
- Looks like the inside of a raincoat.
- Matches!

821
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,667
Oh, yeah,
that's gonna fit nicely, sweetie.

822
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,169
- Try it on.
- Thank you.

823
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,503
No, Ben, put it on.

824
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,506
No, you should try it on, otherwise
you don't know if it's gonna fit.

825
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,675
- Go for it.
- Manners never hurt anybody.

826
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,761
I was just gonna save it
for a special occasion.

827
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,804
All right. Check that out.

828
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,265
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

829
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,767
Hey.

830
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,144
You're a vision in khaki.

831
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:52,442
It's gonna be a happy little family,
just the three of us.

832
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,611
We are, aren't we?

833
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:57,197
- Wow.
- He's our boy, Ben.

834
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,199
Oh, see, that's sweet.

835
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,956
Hey, hey, hey, Andie.
It is good to see you, too, sweetie.

836
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,459
Got you. Got you, got you, got you.

837
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,379
He's just not potty-trained yet.

838
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:16,216
Whoa! Okay, well, he's a pisser.

839
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,219
- Come here, little tinkle king.
- No, no, no.

840
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:22,388
- Come here, tinkle king.
- He is a tinkle king.

841
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,390
My little tinkler. You tinkle, tinkle.

842
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:27,644
Well, congratulations, little plaid family.

843
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,312
You know, we got
a whole bunch of work we gotta do,

844
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,397
but we're still on for poker
at your house, this week, yeah?

845
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:33,983
- Oh, you can count on it.
- Boys night.

846
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:37,487
Well, it was nice meeting you
and, of course, Krull.

847
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,905
Bye. Say bye, Krully.

848
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,156
Little soap and water will take that off.

849
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,325
- He goes, "Woof, woof. "
- Yeah, thank you, buds.

850
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,369
Oh, come here.

851
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:48,081
- Do you love him?
- Oh, I do.

852
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,667
Oh, look at Krull's necklace.

853
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,002
He's got more ice than Liberace,
don't you?

854
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,213
Oh, it's just a little frosting.

855
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,552
- Frosting?
- Frosting.

856
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,889
We were thinking bold, new, fresh.

857
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,933
Frost yourself.

858
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,853
- Excuse me?
- Frost yourself.

859
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,938
- The slogan for the campaign.
- You frost a cake.

860
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,356
We're in the middle
of a meeting, Benjamin.

861
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,775
I'm talking about diamonds.
They're frosting.

862
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,195
As in, "Whoa,
would you check out her frosting. "

863
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,446
Frost yourself.

864
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:22,031
- Frost yourself.
- How did you come up with it?

865
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,285
I got it off the woman
who's falling madly in love with me.

866
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,704
It may have possibilities,
but as far as the woman

867
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:31,207
who's falling madly in love with you,
I will decide that at the party.

868
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,042
- If he can get her there.
- Now just think about it.

869
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:37,255
- Ladies, frost yourself.
- Frost yourself.

870
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,132
We can introduce it at the party.

871
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,550
- It should be the theme.
- Yes.

872
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,135
- Everything frosted.
- All of it.

873
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,554
- Martini glasses.
- Chandeliers.

874
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,472
- Jewels everywhere.
- The women.

875
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:50,602
- The whole party, a sparkling diamond.
- All of it frosted.

876
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,232
Women of New York, frost yourselves!

877
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:59,986
- Hey, frost this!
- Well, I like it.

878
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,744
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.

879
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,747
You have 17 new messages.

880
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,334
- Message one, received at 5:44.
- Sit down. Sit.

881
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:17,003
Hi, sweetie pea. It's me.
Where are you?

882
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,506
- I'm not home.
- Two, received at 5:47.

883
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:23,593
Benny, it's Andie.
Guess you're not home.

884
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,095
Three, received at 5:48.

885
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,431
Benny bear,
are you not answering your phone?

886
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:32,518
- Yes, I am.
- Four, received at 5:49.

887
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,688
Hey, buddy. Game three tonight.
Blondie's. Don't be late. I will kill you.

888
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,315
- Who is it?
- It's me.

889
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:41,319
- Five, received at 5:52.
- It's me.

890
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,825
- What a surprise.
- I've been trying to get a hold of you.

891
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,037
- Yeah?
- I did something kind of wacky.

892
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,665
- Yeah?
- Yes.

893
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:57,293
I used Photoshop at work today
to composite our faces together

894
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:59,462
to see what our kids would look like.

895
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,381
"Our family album. "

896
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,271
You don't wanna see our children?

897
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,067
We don't have children.

898
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:34,956
I hate you.

899
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:40,878
You know what? I'm sorry. No, no, no.
I didn't mean it like that.

900
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,506
All right? Show me, show me,
show me, show me.

901
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,259
- Please show me.
- "We don't have children!"

902
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,054
No, I thought you meant Krull.
I just wanted...

903
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:52,640
- Will you show them to me?
- You don't wanna see them.

904
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,350
I do. Please.

905
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:58,104
Please show them to me.
I really do wanna see them.

906
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,564
Really?

907
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,233
- Yeah.
- Okay.

908
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,445
Oh, that's our wedding.

909
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,909
And this is our first child, Benny Jr.

910
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,912
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

911
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,666
Oh, there's us vacationing in Hawaii.

912
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,963
Little Andie's on my shoulders
and Benjamin Jr. on yours.

913
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

914
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,968
There's little Andie.
Oh, there are the kids in Switzerland.

915
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,803
Yode-lodeling.

916
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,680
Our kids are really

917
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,600
attractive.

918
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,857
Yeah?

919
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,818
Hey, Mom.

920
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,072
Yeah, I'm doing fine. Yeah.

921
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,199
Yeah, yeah, she is. Just a second.
It's for you.

922
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,700
Oh, great.

923
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,036
Hi, Glenda.

924
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,999
- Why is my mom calling you?
- I just showed him.

925
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:05,505
Yeah. Well, he thinks our children
will be very attractive.

926
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,343
Oh, no.

927
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,680
All right, you go back to cooking.
Call me later.

928
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:18,518
Tomorrow. Yeah, great.
Okay, Glenda. Love you, too. Bye.

929
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,896
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah.

930
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:26,067
So, you and my mom, you talk, huh?

931
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,322
Yeah, I called her to get some
baby pictures of you for our book.

932
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:36,160
Hey, you never told me
that you wore diapers till you were five.

933
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,040
You know what, honey,
I gotta go to the...

934
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,293
Oh, no. Come on!

935
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:47,547
You think maybe he thinks
the felt is grass?

936
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,368
Oh, man!

937
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,300
Oh, no, no, no! Man, come on!

938
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,267
- Hey, Benny bear?
- Hey.

939
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,561
- Do you have plans tonight?
- Tonight?

940
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,980
I have another surprise for you.

941
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:50,484
You know what?
Not a good night for me.

942
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:53,404
- I gotta work, of all things.
- Oh, no.

943
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,698
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I got a Knicks game on.

944
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,450
I had a broccoli and asparagus
casserole

945
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,952
planned for you and me,
right there, in front of the TV,

946
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,705
and we're not gonna be able to do that
either 'cause I gotta go into work.

947
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,042
That's too bad
'cause I had tickets for tonight.

948
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,128
- Tickets?
- Tickets, great tickets.

949
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:14,467
Front-row seats, right in the action.
I mean, you can smell sweat.

950
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,221
I guess I...

951
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:22,558
I don't really have to.

952
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:25,811
Why don't I call Tony,
and he can come fill in for me, right?

953
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,814
- Great.
- Oh, yeah! Thank you.

954
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,818
- Honey, you're more than welcome.
- Yes!

955
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,073
Oh, look what time it is, huh?

956
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,162
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,
and I'm gonna share it with you.

957
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,879
Reaches up, she brings it down.

958
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,716
It's the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

959
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,972
And after all this,
he still didn't leave you?

960
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,432
I'm telling you,
this calls for drastic measures.

961
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,601
Come on, guys. Concentrate.

962
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:11,274
- Are you being clingy?
- Clingy, needy, whiny.

963
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,650
Baby talk?

964
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,736
Occasionally.
I mean, I could kick that up a notch.

965
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:18,030
I used to obsess
over Mike's old girlfriends.

966
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,950
Or better yet,
talk about all your old boyfriends.

967
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,911
Good. It's good, it's good,
but it's not gonna crack this guy.

968
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,663
I mean, this is DEFCON 5,

969
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,749
and I have to do something
truly appalling.

970
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,501
It's not funny!

971
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:35,131
Look, I have to think of something
before tomorrow.

972
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,133
Wait, why not tonight?

973
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:40,845
- Poker night. Boys' night out.
- Mike used to have a boys' night.

974
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,888
Boys' night?
You're giving him a boys' night?

975
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:47,435
- They do it every week.
- Before he met you.

976
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:53,024
- What are you suggesting?
- I think you know what I'm suggesting.

977
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,861
- Feel lucky, boys?
- Yeah.

978
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:59,780
- You know, Ben.
- That's 2 bucks.

979
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,574
I'm feeling luckier than you

980
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:05,036
'cause I do not have to sit through
a Celine Dion concert.

981
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,455
That is what true love is all about,
my friend.

982
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,831
I fold.

983
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,334
I see your 2, raise you 50.
She's in love with you?

984
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,377
Are you kidding me?
She's planning the wedding.

985
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:16,547
- Call.
- All right, guys, read them and weep.

986
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,799
Got ladies over fours. Huh?

987
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,927
- Damn!
- I have a three and an ace.

988
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,722
It does not get any better than this.

989
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,475
- Look at that.
- Bennykins, I'm home.

990
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,855
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Andie.

991
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,944
- She has a key?
- Is that legal?

992
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:43,115
I wasn't expecting you.

993
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,076
How'd you get a key?

994
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:49,914
Oh, honey, Francesco, your super,
he made me a copy.

995
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,167
Francesco, huh?

996
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,878
- All right.
- You're not mad, are you, Benky-wenky?

997
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,338
- No, I'm not mad.
- You're not mad?

998
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,631
No, no, no, no. I'm not mad.

999
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,800
- Oh, good.
- You know the guys? Everybody.

1000
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,302
- Tony, Thayer, Francis.
- Oh, yes.

1001
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,597
- Watch out! Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no!

1002
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,100
Tony. Hi, Tony.

1003
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,559
- Ronald.
- Hello.

1004
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,061
- Joe.
- Joe.

1005
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,312
- Hey.
- Andie...

1006
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,147
I didn't mean to interrupt
your little game.

1007
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:18,067
- We're all...
- I brought some yummy snacks.

1008
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:22,154
- Snacks?
- The game is hold 'em.

1009
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,865
Three up for company,
ante a dollar, please.

1010
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:30,788
- Tony! Yucky, yucky pizza. Yucky pizza.
- Oh, no!

1011
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,290
Yummy, yummy cucumber sandwich.

1012
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,461
- First card up is a nine.
- Thanks.

1013
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,590
- I'll take one.
- Yeah. Sure, yeah.

1014
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,259
Good boys. Good.

1015
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,845
Here we go. Get rid of those over there.
Thank you very much.

1016
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,222
- Three up. Three up.
- I went a buck. You follow?

1017
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,723
- Buck around the horn.
- See it.

1018
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,309
Buck around the horn.
Buck around the horn.

1019
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,038
Thanks, Benny.

1020
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,540
Thayer!

1021
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,792
- That means you, too, Thayer.
- Oh, yeah.

1022
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:19,587
All right, everyone in for a buck.
Next card five.

1023
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,715
Nines and fives. Nines and fives.
That's back to you, Tito.

1024
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,926
Nine and a seven! Go for the straight!

1025
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,056
Round two.
Tone the Bone, you're up, man.

1026
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,808
She told you my hand.

1027
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,602
- Peek-a-boo!
- Hi.

1028
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,188
Hey.

1029
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,440
Guys, you wanna play cards here?
What's going on?

1030
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,484
What game are we playing?

1031
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,985
We're playing hold 'em.

1032
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,446
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right.

1033
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,282
All right. I'm already maxed out.
We got a nine up. Nine up, guys.

1034
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,034
- Nine up...
- Blow.

1035
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,997
Blow. Nobody likes a Mr. Sniffles.

1036
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,751
- I hate Mr. Sniffles.
- Come on, stuffy head.

1037
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,425
Good. We're good.

1038
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,469
White. Healthy boy.

1039
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,262
- Good.
- Healthy.

1040
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,060
- Oh, no.
- Are we playing?

1041
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,686
Oh, no.

1042
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,606
Our love fern!

1043
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,401
It's dead!

1044
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:31,033
- No, honey. It's just sleeping.
- You let it die!

1045
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,454
You gonna let us die?

1046
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,709
You should think about that.

1047
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,296
What the hell's a love fern?

1048
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:50,427
All right, guys.
Let's try to get through one hand.

1049
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,474
Is she on something?

1050
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,143
God, I hope so.

1051
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,441
Hi.

1052
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,240
Are you saying
I'm some kind of mental person?

1053
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,242
- Hey, hey.
- No, no, he wasn't...

1054
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,827
- Oh, Tony!
- What?

1055
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,328
He was talking about...

1056
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,663
- That's it!
- Come on.

1057
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,498
- That is it!
- Andie.

1058
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,669
I'm taking this love fern with me.

1059
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,681
Hang on.

1060
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:36,932
Hey.

1061
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,602
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1062
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,437
What just happened in there?

1063
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,522
- I'm gonna go listen.
- Yeah.

1064
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,857
Quietly.

1065
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,693
Look, this is getting really creepy,
all right?

1066
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,529
You're acting completely insane.
You know that?

1067
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:54,116
- So I am insane?
- No, you're acting insane.

1068
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,035
Shut up, Krull.

1069
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,038
- He's an innocent animal!
- Yeah, yeah.

1070
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,706
And he'll live, okay? I'm talking to you.

1071
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,125
I don't know if I can be with somebody
who doesn't like animals

1072
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,210
and thinks I'm a mental person.

1073
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:07,046
That's what I'm talking about.

1074
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:12,051
Where is the sexy, cool, fun, smart,
beautiful Andie that I knew?

1075
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:15,137
The one who wanted to be
a serious journalist, huh?

1076
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,889
You're up, you're down,
you're here, you're there.

1077
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,975
You're like
a freaking one-woman circus, Andie.

1078
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,728
- So I guess this means we're over.
- Yeah, I guess so.

1079
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,563
- Fine.
- Fine!

1080
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,400
Oh, finally.

1081
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,667
- It's over, men.
- Oh, man, that's...

1082
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:48,170
- No, no, no.
- It is, man. It's over.

1083
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,422
- Four more days.
- Guys, you were here.

1084
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,675
Did you just witness the
one-woman homage to The Exorcist?

1085
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,427
- You saw it! Huh?
- Yeah, I did. I thought it was sexy.

1086
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,763
- Yeah.
- It was not sexy.

1087
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,432
- He's right.
- Forget it. He's right.

1088
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,851
So do you think Spears and Green

1089
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,687
are gonna be comfortable
in their new office?

1090
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,188
- Oh, absolutely.
- No, no. Guys, stop.

1091
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,190
Maybe he's excited
that he's gonna be selling Nerf footballs

1092
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,525
- for the rest of his life.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1093
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:10,859
He may get, like,
a really good douche campaign.

1094
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,278
- Hey, it's done. All right? What? What?
- Couples therapy.

1095
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:14,530
- Of course!
- What?

1096
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,032
Every time my wife wants to divorce me,
I suggest couples therapy.

1097
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:19,535
- It'll buy you at least four days.
- It's true. She hates him.

1098
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,704
- Couples therapy. Couples therapy.
- Yeah, couples therapy.

1099
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,622
- Couples therapy!
- Couples therapy.

1100
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:24,873
- Couples therapy.
- Come on!

1101
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,042
- Couples therapy! Couples therapy!
- Couples therapy!

1102
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:29,128
Therapy! Couples therapy!

1103
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,892
Andie. Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1104
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:47,229
Listen, can you forgive me, sugar puss?
Look, I don't know what I was thinking.

1105
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,897
All right? I'm sorry.

1106
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:52,776
I am way out of line, Andie.
Can you give me another chance?

1107
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,780
Haven't you had enough?

1108
01:07:57,449 --> 01:08:00,325
- Hey, look, I'm willing to do anything.
- Get up.

1109
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,953
- I'll do anything, Andie.
- Get up.

1110
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,664
Look, what do you think about...

1111
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,835
What do you think about
couples therapy?

1112
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,422
- Couples therapy?
- Couples therapy.

1113
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,507
Look, Thayer up there,
he's got this doctor.

1114
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,009
He says he's a hell of a guy.

1115
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,678
No, I know a therapist
who will work wonders

1116
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,347
- with somebody like you, Benjamin.
- Yes. That's what I need.

1117
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,683
I will call and schedule
an emergency session.

1118
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,853
- Baby, whatever it takes.
- A kiss.

1119
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,855
Thank you, sweetheart.

1120
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,358
Thank you for understanding.

1121
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:37,529
I love you, Benky,
but I don't have to like you right now.

1122
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,453
Thank you, Andie.

1123
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:53,378
Damn it! Shit!

1124
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:59,176
If you're really gonna commit to this,
you're gonna have to open up.

1125
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,345
- Yeah.
- And dig deep.

1126
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,055
- Okay.
- Bare that beautiful soul.

1127
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,973
Let me see your teeth.

1128
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,061
Andie Anderson. Benjamin Barry.

1129
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,731
Please come in. Hi. Welcome.

1130
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:23,492
Before we get started, how are you
planning on paying for the session?

1131
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,244
- Sweetie?
- How much is it?

1132
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,412
- $300.
- $300?

1133
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,792
Whatever it takes. Yeah.

1134
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:35,754
So, tell me, how long have you guys
been seeing each other?

1135
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,383
- Seven days.
- Seven days. Interesting.

1136
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,094
Is that too soon
to be seeing a therapist?

1137
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,681
Well, Ben, seven days
isn't like a lifetime or anything.

1138
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,850
- It's like a week.
- It...

1139
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,936
Did you hear that tone?

1140
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,815
How can we not have a gulf between us
with a tone like that?

1141
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,526
How are things between you sexually?

1142
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:05,200
- We haven't had sex.
- Oh, no, Ben has a little-bitty problem.

1143
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,286
- I don't have a problem.
- Yes, you do.

1144
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,955
- No, I do not have a problem.
- Yeah. It's a big problem.

1145
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,415
- I do not have a problem.
- You have a problem.

1146
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,208
Look, look, wait a minute. The one night

1147
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:16,795
that we even thought about getting close
to having sex,

1148
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,673
all right, she up and decides
she's gonna nickname my...

1149
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:23,135
- Penis.
- Yeah. Princess Sophia.

1150
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,638
You want to talk about
shooting a man's horse? Come on.

1151
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:30,726
- I thought it was a beautiful name.
- I see, Benjamin.

1152
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,897
And when was it that you first realized
that you were attracted to other men?

1153
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,149
- Oh, that's serious.
- What?

1154
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,570
- Benjamin, this is a safe space.
- Look, it's just simple.

1155
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,865
I like women, okay?
It just happened that way.

1156
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,451
Methinks thou doth protesteth too much.

1157
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,328
You see? Stop it.
This is the shit I'm talking about.

1158
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:50,871
- What the hell was that?
- What did I do?

1159
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:53,665
I mean, this is what she does. Stop that!

1160
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:58,795
You know, I'm hearing a lot
of latent anger here, Benjamin.

1161
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,924
- Rage-aholic.
- I'm not a rage-aholic.

1162
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,175
- I called that one.
- Stop!

1163
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,928
You know what?
Take a deep breath for me, Ben.

1164
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,597
Okay, let it go. Just let it go.

1165
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,683
- Yeah.
- I feel better.

1166
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:12,976
Okay.

1167
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:17,814
Come here. I've seen this before,
and I've seen it many times.

1168
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1169
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:23,278
- Would you two like to be left alone?
- No.

1170
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,238
Maybe you should get a room.

1171
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:28,742
- You are hitting on our shrink.
- No, I'm not.

1172
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,870
Yes, you are,
and you are a pathological flirt!

1173
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:35,791
Jesus! Five seconds ago I'm gay.
Now I'm a pathological flirt.

1174
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,211
- I sweat when I get nervous.
- Which one is it, Andie?

1175
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,296
Besides, why would I need
to hit on another woman?

1176
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,923
You've got
more than enough personalities

1177
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,008
to keep me completely occupied.

1178
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:50,097
- That was hurtful.
- Okay. Ben, are you ashamed of Andie?

1179
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,182
- Of course he is!
- I'm not ashamed.

1180
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,976
- Of course he is. You are.
- I'm not ashamed.

1181
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,728
- How do you think that makes me feel?
- I'm not ashamed of you.

1182
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:01,858
It's like, when I talked to his mother,
he freaked out.

1183
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,611
No. You did that behind my back.
She did it behind my back.

1184
01:12:04,696 --> 01:12:08,198
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Andie, you wanna talk to my mother?

1185
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,409
You wanna talk to my mother?
Talk to my mother.

1186
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:13,954
Hey, you wanna talk to the whole family,
you can talk to the whole family.

1187
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,873
Hell, we can go to Staten Island,
spend the weekend with them, Andie.

1188
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,584
Now that is a positive idea, Ben.

1189
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,671
- It is?
- How about it, Andie?

1190
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,507
- What?
- Would you like to go to Staten Island?

1191
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,032
Uncle Ben! Hi!

1192
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:56,204
- Thanks.
- Yes, ma'am.

1193
01:12:56,748 --> 01:13:00,375
- Hey, Mom, Pop, we're here.
- Yeah, bullshit!

1194
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,044
Who's that handsome guy?

1195
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,296
That's my dad
when he was an ensign in the Navy.

1196
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:05,964
He got stationed here
about 10 years ago.

1197
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,883
Bullshit!

1198
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,635
- Hey, darling, I'm glad to see you.
- Hey, sweetie, how you doing?

1199
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,055
- Good. Perfect timing.
- You know who this is?

1200
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,724
I do, and I'll let you check the baby,
see if he needs changing.

1201
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:19,311
Hi, Andie. I'm so happy
to have you here in the flesh.

1202
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,313
You're just as pretty
as you sound on the telephone.

1203
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,149
- Glenda!
- I'm coming! Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1204
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,651
- Excuse me. Show her upstairs, okay?
- Oh, yeah.

1205
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:30,155
- And this is Joey Jr.
- Bullshit!

1206
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,907
And the whole family
suffers from Tourette's.

1207
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,075
I hope that's not a problem.

1208
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,659
- And Joey, here...
- You're so handsome!

1209
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,078
...suffers from being a stinky rose.

1210
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,914
We're gonna get you cleaned up.
So go out back. Have a good time.

1211
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,332
Okay.

1212
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,503
- Got you!
- Okay!

1213
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:48,298
- You're it!
- He got you.

1214
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,927
- Uncle Arnold says he's got three kings.
- Yeah, right.

1215
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:55,180
Okay, Uncle Arnold, now, dare I say it
or not? I'm gonna just say it.

1216
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,599
Okay, I'm gonna say it. Bullshit!

1217
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,103
- Hi.
- Honey.

1218
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,938
- Oh, wow.
- Andie!

1219
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,440
- Well, well, well.
- Come on out here, Andie.

1220
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:06,775
- Meet everybody.
- Okay.

1221
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,278
- I want you to meet Ben's father.
- Well, hello!

1222
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,614
- Jack, this is Andie, Jack.
- Welcome to our humble abode.

1223
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,950
- This is our Uncle Arnold.
- Hi, Uncle Arnold.

1224
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,785
- This is Andie.
- You gotta watch him.

1225
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,871
He farts like a howitzer, but he's family,
so what are you gonna do?

1226
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,456
Intestinal complications.

1227
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:23,125
- Yeah, right, Arnold.
- Prunes!

1228
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,376
Did you meet Joey?

1229
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,627
- A female Andie.
- I-E.

1230
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,795
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

1231
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,381
Okay. Here we go now.
The game is Bullshit,

1232
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,800
and you are just in time
for the lightning round, my dear.

1233
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,301
I don't really know how to play.

1234
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,554
Well, we're gonna teach you.
It's very simple.

1235
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,557
The trick is to get rid of all the cards
in your hand, all right?

1236
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,143
So I'm gonna look at my hand
I'm gonna see what I've got, here.

1237
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,061
And well, you know,
I've got two aces here.

1238
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,981
Well, two aces.
What do you say to that?

1239
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,069
What are you gonna say?

1240
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,322
- I say bullshit.
- What did she say? I didn't quite hear.

1241
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,907
Did you guys?
I didn't hear what she said.

1242
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,243
- I said bullshit!
- All right!

1243
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,829
- She knows how to play the game!
- Yes, sir!

1244
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,498
- Is that big daddy?
- Come to Papa.

1245
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,334
Get on over there, big man.
Slick as a whistle.

1246
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,086
- How you doing, Unc?
- Not bad.

1247
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,838
- Pop.
- Hey, how you doing, buddy?

1248
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,007
- Got a game of Bullshit going here?
- You want to join us?

1249
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,093
- Good luck.
- The expert here.

1250
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,929
Okay, now, we went through the deck.
We're gonna start at the beginning now.

1251
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,016
So we go to twos. Let's see.
I got myself one deuce here.

1252
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,684
Bullshit.

1253
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,521
- Bullshit, Pop.
- He's a human lie detector, isn't he?

1254
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:28,857
Try this, son. Two threes.

1255
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,861
- One four.
- Three fives.

1256
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,863
Bullshit.

1257
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,951
You see whose name's
on the top of the board over there?

1258
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,454
Yes. It says Ben, with a star next to it.

1259
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,291
- You still wanna bullshit me?
- God, you must be so proud.

1260
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,210
I'm doing my best. What do we got?

1261
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:52,797
- Did I... No, I told the truth.
- Three fives.

1262
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:56,134
- All right, all right.
- He's good. He's the champ.

1263
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,930
- What am I?
- Sixes to you.

1264
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,891
- One six.
- One six. All right.

1265
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,559
Look what I got here.
I got myself two sevens.

1266
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:07,395
You see, the key to this game
is being able to read people.

1267
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,481
- Two eights.
- Bullshit.

1268
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,609
Bullshit, Mama.

1269
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,154
I'm gonna have to hurt you.

1270
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,407
You see, Mom's never been
that great at it, but why?

1271
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,826
- Just 'cause I'm so pure of heart.
- So pure of heart.

1272
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:23,912
Bullshit.

1273
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:28,124
Hello? Hello, where is everybody? Hey!

1274
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:32,754
This is Andie.
Andie, this is my sister, Dora.

1275
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,589
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1276
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:36,758
Andie is kicking Ben's ass in Bullshit.

1277
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,677
- I like this girl.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1278
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:42,013
- That's right.
- Ben's starting a little card collection.

1279
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:46,434
All right. Let me get back on track here.
Gentle Ben starts with three ladies.

1280
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,521
That's to you.
What do you got to say about that?

1281
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,321
Bullshit.

1282
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,200
You heard me. I said bullshit.

1283
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,874
What is that, seven in a row, Sparky?

1284
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,877
I think somebody's met his match.

1285
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:18,133
Well, it's all about reading people.

1286
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:21,636
- Loser.
- Okay. Two kings.

1287
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,810
Bullshit?

1288
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,898
Bullshit!

1289
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:37,319
What's all that? Yeah, you!

1290
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:41,489
- I'm your daddy, now.
- You have met your match!

1291
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,993
And you, Mom, Miss Pure of Heart.
Pop, we'll talk later.

1292
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:49,497
You're hiding behind a badge. Cheated.
Betrayed by my own parents.

1293
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:54,002
The only honest man in this place
is Uncle Arnold, who's asleep.

1294
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,837
- But I won!
- I'm gonna go inside

1295
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,590
and play with the kids.
Maybe they won't lie, cheat and steal.

1296
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,258
Okay, keep my name
at the top of the board.

1297
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:03,762
Now, Andie, I hope you know
that we expect you to come back here

1298
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:07,349
because you have held Ben
to his lowest Bullshit score

1299
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,434
- since his tonsillectomy...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1300
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:13,355
- ... and we are thrilled!
- Lowest!

1301
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,024
Why, were all his other girlfriends
Bullshit losers?

1302
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,526
- What other girlfriends?
- Ma, he's picky.

1303
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,780
You are the first girl
he's ever brought home.

1304
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,616
Don't you break his heart, now.

1305
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,911
And that dress! Andie!
Now, does that come in my size?

1306
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:53,645
- My turn?
- Yes, ma'am.

1307
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:01,653
- It's heavy.
- Turn it on. Good.

1308
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:04,239
- Keep the clutch in.
- That's the clutch?

1309
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:06,658
Brake here on your right.
Your gears are on the left.

1310
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,493
- One down.
- Okay.

1311
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,496
Now, when you take off, you're gonna
give a little bit on the clutch,

1312
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:15,250
and then you're gonna go a little
bit here. A little give, a little go.

1313
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:18,002
- How's it go?
- A little give and a little go?

1314
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:19,462
Yeah.

1315
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,888
Clutch! Clutch and a little brake.
There we are.

1316
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,144
- You got it?
- I got it. I got it.

1317
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:38,481
You got it. Voilà, voilà, voilà!

1318
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,861
I mean, there's a lot of cool things
about a bike, you know.

1319
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:45,989
Use less gas, no traffic jam,

1320
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,991
you can park
wherever the hell you want.

1321
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:50,326
- At the end of the day...
- Thank you.

1322
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,203
...chicks dig them.

1323
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,838
You look so cute.
Let me ask you a question.

1324
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:05,383
- Chicks dig this?
- Yes, chicks dig this.

1325
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,353
- I turned!
- Who's driving like a pro?

1326
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,900
Yeah, look at you!

1327
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:24,903
Look at this look.

1328
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:28,740
Right. Now, this shower,
it's a little bit tricky.

1329
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,742
The hot is actually cold,
the cold is actually hot.

1330
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:33,077
You gotta crank it all the way up at first,

1331
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:36,998
and if somebody
flushes the toilet in Bayonne,

1332
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,709
you are gonna get scalded.

1333
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,794
Towels are right there.

1334
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,177
Everything all right? Is this okay?

1335
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,638
Oh, no. It's more than okay.

1336
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:57,936
I love everything about this house.
The noise, the smells.

1337
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,773
Oh. Well, the smells,
that's Uncle Arnold. I mean...

1338
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,621
What's wrong?

1339
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:20,959
It's just that
when your mama hugged me today,

1340
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,254
she really hugged me

1341
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,467
for winning a game of Bullshit.

1342
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,179
Sweetie, that's a good thing.

1343
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,014
Smile.

1344
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,768
Smile. Now, come on, give me a smile.

1345
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:42,438
Okay, that's good. That's it.
You're scaring me.

1346
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:02,412
- This is home, huh?
- This is home.

1347
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,550
Hey, listen, tomorrow night
my boss is throwing a party

1348
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:18,261
for that diamond account
I was telling you about.

1349
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,638
I want you to come with me.

1350
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,015
- Okay.
- Okay?

1351
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,851
Yeah.

1352
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,480
As my girlfriend.

1353
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:38,531
- Are you calling me your girlfriend?
- Yeah. I think I am.

1354
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:48,666
Won't tomorrow be the tenth day
we've been seeing each other?

1355
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,336
Maybe after that we'll know.

1356
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,718
Listen, don't make any plans
for day 13, okay?

1357
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:03,222
'Cause we have a game to go to.

1358
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:07,101
They're not as good
as seats as you got us,

1359
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:09,103
but this is game seven.

1360
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:10,354
Yes?

1361
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,232
Oh, come here.

1362
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,299
- Okay.
- Yes?

1363
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,759
Lana,

1364
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,178
I can't write this article.

1365
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:47,058
- Is your computer broken?
- I've gotten to know this guy.

1366
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:53,064
Andie, do you see any patches
or insignia anywhere on my clothing?

1367
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:55,733
No.

1368
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,319
It's because I'm not
your Girl Scout leader, I'm your boss.

1369
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:00,530
You'll write the article.

1370
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:04,951
This cover is at the printer as we speak,
with a special section on diamonds,

1371
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:09,288
which is going to take care of
my ad quota for the entire year.

1372
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,666
I want copy on my desk in 48 hours.

1373
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,419
- Okay, but Lana...
- No "but Lana," you'll do it.

1374
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:19,131
Because you're a professional.

1375
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,970
Yes, I am.

1376
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:00,631
You're beautiful.

1377
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:12,226
You look pretty good, too, Sparky.

1378
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,076
- Champagne, madame?
- Thank you.

1379
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,507
Chalk one up to couples therapy.

1380
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:46,928
Some party.

1381
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,182
You're gonna do great.

1382
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:53,768
I'm gonna go to the bar
and get us a couple drinks.

1383
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,186
- Oh, good idea.
- Okay?

1384
01:27:55,270 --> 01:28:01,192
And while I do that, would you please
head over there and frost yourself?

1385
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:06,447
- I can wear those?
- Yes, ma'am, you can.

1386
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:16,958
- Phillip!
- Lana!

1387
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,584
I don't see you at a party for ages.

1388
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,462
Now, here you are,
throwing the bash of the year.

1389
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,005
I'm glad you could make it.

1390
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,174
- Like them?
- It suits you.

1391
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:26,634
I know!

1392
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,386
Harry Winston.

1393
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:32,890
How did you get all these jewelers
to agree to appear at the same fête?

1394
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:36,602
- At the request of Mrs. DeLauer.
- Really?

1395
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:41,774
You see, Mr. DeLauer
controls 70% of the world's diamonds,

1396
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,986
and Mrs. DeLauer controls Mr. DeLauer.

1397
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:48,239
- You're bad.
- Enjoy.

1398
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,616
Lana!

1399
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,911
- And this is real?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1400
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:55,413
I insist.

1401
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:59,417
- Yes, sir.
- Such beauty should be celebrated.

1402
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:06,173
- Isadora.
- Oh, no. I'm Andie.

1403
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:10,428
And a pleasure to meet you, Andie,
but this is Isadora.

1404
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,179
Turn.

1405
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:18,352
Eighty-four karats,
named for Isadora Duncan.

1406
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:21,397
- Congratulations. You got her here.
- Yup.

1407
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:25,317
- But the question remains.
- Does she or doesn't she?

1408
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:30,281
We're gonna find out.

1409
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:34,535
- An angel of God.
- Thanks.

1410
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:37,204
- I am Frederic.
- Andie Anderson.

1411
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:43,794
Well, it looks like
you've got some competition, anyway.

1412
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,675
Miss Anderson
will be wearing Isadora for the evening.

1413
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:55,806
- Enjoy the party, Andie.
- Merci beaucoup.

1414
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,769
- Oh, that's stunning!
- Fabulous!

1415
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:03,022
Excuse me.
Two champagnes, please, sir.

1416
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,526
Pardon me, young man.

1417
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:10,404
Would you be kind enough
to order me a whiskey sour?

1418
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:11,697
Yes, ma'am, I can.

1419
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,157
- Mrs. DeLauer?
- Yes.

1420
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,118
- I'm Ben Barry with Warren Advertising.
- How do you do?

1421
01:30:16,203 --> 01:30:18,412
The pleasure is mine.
It's nice to finally meet you.

1422
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:21,415
I'm very happy to meet you, too.
That's for sure.

1423
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,210
Can I get a whiskey sour, please?

1424
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:33,302
I can promise you that our presentation

1425
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,388
will not weary you
in the wrong way, Mrs. DeLauer.

1426
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:41,685
I cannot wait to see
what you present, Benjamin.

1427
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,941
Ladies, do you see what I see?

1428
01:30:49,236 --> 01:30:52,196
Oh, Phillip, that's ridiculous.
She couldn't possibly.

1429
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,031
Don't be so sure.

1430
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:56,534
She might possibly.

1431
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,245
I think I'll go find out.

1432
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:16,470
- Excuse me. You're Andie, yes?
- Yes.

1433
01:31:16,555 --> 01:31:18,389
I'm Phillip Warren.

1434
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:21,225
- Oh, you're Ben's boss.
- That's right.

1435
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:24,562
- Hi. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

1436
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:28,524
I understand you've been an inspiration
to Ben in more ways than one.

1437
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:32,278
And I must say,
you look rather inspired yourself.

1438
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:38,325
There isn't a diamond in the room
that sparkles like a woman in love.

1439
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,411
Oh, no, no.

1440
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:46,250
- I'm not in love.
- No? I guess I was mistaken.

1441
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:49,253
No, no, no. I mean, I just...

1442
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,423
I mean, I've only known him
for 10 days. I...

1443
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:58,012
You can't... I can't be...

1444
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:07,646
Ben is a very lucky man.

1445
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,441
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1446
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:17,198
Mr. Warren, please don't tell him.
Please don't tell him!

1447
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,830
- Ben, Ben.
- Hey, hello, gentlemen.

1448
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,832
- Yeah?
- She loves you, she loves you not?

1449
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,210
- What is it?
- I don't know. We'll see.

1450
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:30,628
Ben!

1451
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,173
- Mr. Warren.
- Saw her, met her, she loves you.

1452
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:36,550
You win. Get ready to pitch.

1453
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:40,179
- All right!
- Yes! Yes!

1454
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:47,228
- Congratulations, point man.
- I'm very proud.

1455
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:51,232
So, you're the new point man
on the DeLauers?

1456
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,525
- She loves me.
- Good for you.

1457
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:55,986
And good for whoever she is.

1458
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:02,409
- Thank you so much.
- You're so very welcome.

1459
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:05,496
- Gloating, are we?
- Yeah. Pretty much.

1460
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,039
- Warren told us so...
- Yeah.

1461
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:09,583
You don't mess with my man, Ben.

1462
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,585
Your man Ben is a cheater.

1463
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,796
The girl has known about the bet
from the beginning.

1464
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,923
She was playing along
so Ben would win.

1465
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,467
Tell him to enjoy his short-lived,
ill-gotten victory.

1466
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:20,928
We're going to talk to Warren.

1467
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,514
No.

1468
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:32,815
- Hey.
- Remember us?

1469
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,358
- Hi!
- Hi.

1470
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:38,195
You know, Warren is gonna
come over here in a minute,

1471
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:42,408
and it would be so great
if you could just, you know,

1472
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:46,120
like, act like you don't know anything
about the bet.

1473
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:50,332
I mean, if you could tell him
that you really, truly love Ben, you know,

1474
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:53,919
and you weren't just, you know,
pretending so he would win,

1475
01:33:54,004 --> 01:33:56,588
that would be huge.

1476
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:59,174
So what's
the average Composure reader like?

1477
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:02,303
Spunky, insatiable. Uppity, you bet.

1478
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,221
If you'll excuse me, Lana,

1479
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:08,100
there's a beautiful young woman
in a yellow dress that I must go to.

1480
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,269
Andie! She's my how-to girl.

1481
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:11,478
- How-to?
- Yes.

1482
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:17,443
Right now she's doing an article
called How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

1483
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:19,778
- Look him straight in the eye...
- Yeah, and just...

1484
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:22,072
You love Ben, and
you never heard anything about any bet.

1485
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,868
- Yeah. Love, no bet.
- I understand.

1486
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:29,913
Awesome. That's great. Thank you.
You look beautiful.

1487
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,166
This poor schmuck
she's been pretending to date,

1488
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,461
well, not even pretending to date,
she's actually dating the guy.

1489
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:38,714
She's doing
the most atrocious things to him.

1490
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:41,925
She's actually named his...

1491
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,054
She's named his...

1492
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,602
You're Krull.

1493
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:03,614
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I ask you all kindly to be seated.

1494
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,658
- Now that we're all suitably frosted...
- Benjamin, where have you been?

1495
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:11,038
- We haven't much time to play.
- ... and the ladies do look lovely,

1496
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:16,001
please help me give a warm welcome
to our special guests of the evening,

1497
01:35:16,086 --> 01:35:18,587
Mr. and Mrs. Frederic DeLauer!

1498
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:32,017
And now I want to introduce
a true musical legend, who will perform

1499
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:37,899
some of his Oscar, Grammy,
Tony and Emmy award-winning songs.

1500
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:41,985
Mr. Marvin Hamlisch.

1501
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,695
Marvin!

1502
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:53,122
Thank you very much. I really do...

1503
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:58,127
Well, yes! Give another hand for...
Marvin Hamlisch is in the house!

1504
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,716
A lot of you out here
don't know Benjamin Barry.

1505
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:06,718
Well, shame on you.

1506
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:10,597
'Cause he is a very talented
advertising executive

1507
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:14,643
and knowledgeable sports fan
and a wagering enthusiast.

1508
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:20,691
But, most impressively,
he is one hell of a singer,

1509
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:24,236
and he has prepared
a little musical snack

1510
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,239
for his new special friend Mrs. DeLauer.

1511
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,366
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

1512
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:33,495
So, Ben, why don't you come up here
and sing your song?

1513
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,791
Come on, Ben!

1514
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:41,545
Ladies and gentlemen, Benjamin Barry!

1515
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:44,548
Come on, Ben.

1516
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:53,932
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1517
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:56,185
Andie, Andie, whoa, whoa, don't run off.
Don't run off!

1518
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:59,980
Ladies and gentlemen, you do not
want this young lady to leave the room.

1519
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,524
Thayer, Tony,
would you stop her, please?

1520
01:37:02,609 --> 01:37:05,235
You see, tonight,
the really special event

1521
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,989
is that we will be singing,
her and I, a duet.

1522
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:10,574
Yes! Miss Andie Anderson!

1523
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,911
Would you please give her
a warm round of applause! Thank you!

1524
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:16,663
Andie! Andie Anderson.

1525
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,251
Knock them out.

1526
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:25,964
Let's see what our song tonight will be.
Maybe one of her personal favorites.

1527
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,718
Marvin, do you know You're So Vain?

1528
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:32,763
That's not one of my songs.

1529
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,724
Can you work with me, Marvin? Yeah?

1530
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:41,188
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1531
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:43,982
You walked into the party

1532
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:47,611
Like you were walking onto a yacht

1533
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:51,240
You had your hat pulled down
real strategically over one eye

1534
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:53,909
You had a scarf I think it was apricot

1535
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:55,786
- Strategically tipped below one eye.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,704
You had one eye in the mirror

1537
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:59,873
As you make sure you got a real cool...

1538
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:01,291
- Gavotte.
- Gavotte? Yeah.

1539
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:04,378
And all the girls think
that they'd be your partner

1540
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:06,713
They'd be his partner 'cause

1541
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:09,716
He's so vain

1542
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:12,302
You probably think this song
is about you

1543
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:15,097
Ben Barry, you're so vain

1544
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:17,683
You probably think this song
is about you

1545
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:19,893
Don't you? Don't you?

1546
01:38:19,978 --> 01:38:21,853
Tone-deaf and drunk
is not a good combination.

1547
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:25,732
You fooled me to win a bet
and you should feel ashamed

1548
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:28,151
Look, you took me
to a goddamn Celine Dion concert

1549
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:30,195
You made me miss the big game!

1550
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,364
Oh, smart guy's a rhymer

1551
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:36,410
Well, do we want everybody to know
your lovemaking is lame?

1552
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:38,078
Maybe 'cause you named my penis

1553
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:39,371
Yeah, you named my penis

1554
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:43,375
You named my penis after a dame!

1555
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,711
I really think you have to get over that.

1556
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:48,755
- Come on. You're so vain!
- No, you're so vain!

1557
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,257
This is the worst thing I've ever heard.

1558
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,967
You know that this song's about you,
don't you?

1559
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:57,056
- No! Because you're so vain!
- So vain! You're so vain!

1560
01:38:58,141 --> 01:39:00,976
Yeah, you do know the words so well,
don't you?

1561
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:04,396
There she goes, ladies and gentlemen.
There she goes.

1562
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,399
- Thanks, guys.
- Take it from here, Marvin.

1563
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,655
Wasn't she wearing
the Isadora diamond?

1564
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,949
Isadora! Mon dieu! Security!

1565
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,911
No, no, no, no.

1566
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,122
Hold on, Andie Anderson.
I'm not done with you.

1567
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:24,958
You used me
to get ahead in your work...

1568
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:27,836
- I used you?
- ... you arrogant, backstabbing jerk!

1569
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,838
- Hold it! Lady, hold it!
- Come on, Andie.

1570
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,841
All right, you drove me half insane
for a goddamn magazine article.

1571
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:35,761
Oh, yeah, and you told people you could
make any girl fall in love with you,

1572
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:37,679
- and I, I was exhibit A.
- Ma'am?

1573
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:38,889
Time out!

1574
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,098
- What?
- What?

1575
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:41,892
Look, please, just give me the necklace.

1576
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:44,770
Then you guys can go on
and kill each other.

1577
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:52,653
So that's what I was, huh?
I was a guinea pig.

1578
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:54,446
Somebody you could test
your theories on?

1579
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:59,242
Yeah, and I was just a girl
somebody picked out in a bar.

1580
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,495
Yeah, you know what? Big deal.

1581
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:05,957
Hell, I'm sure now you can even use it
as a little twist in your story.

1582
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:08,960
That's a good idea.
Maybe we should bet on it.

1583
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,172
You know what?
You did your job now, Andie.

1584
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,841
- Yes, I did.
- You wanted to lose a guy in 10 days.

1585
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:18,720
Congratulations. You did it.
You just lost him.

1586
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:22,432
No, I didn't, Ben.

1587
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:26,561
'Cause you can't lose something
you never had.

1588
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:53,255
Well, it's not what I expected.

1589
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:57,551
It's better.

1590
01:40:57,635 --> 01:40:59,219
Congratulations.

1591
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:02,639
This shows me
you're ready to be unleashed.

1592
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:06,643
From now on,
feel free to write about anything.

1593
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,312
Anything?

1594
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,982
Wherever the wind blows you.

1595
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:18,196
- Even politics?
- The wind's not going to blow you there.

1596
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,827
What about religion, poverty,
economics?

1597
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,913
This wind is really
more of a light breeze.

1598
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:32,335
- What can I write about, Lana?
- Whatever you want.

1599
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:37,174
Shoes, laser therapy,
dressing for your body type.

1600
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:40,260
Use your imagination.
The sky is the limit.

1601
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:47,142
- Thank you for this opportunity, Lana.
- Okay.

1602
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:52,105
And thank you for making it easy
for me to turn down.

1603
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,572
No, I mean, look,
it's not something I'm proud of.

1604
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:03,283
Obviously, if I could do it over again,

1605
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:06,203
I'd do some things differently,
you know.

1606
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:12,125
I tell you, it's good to talk to you,
though, man. It really is.

1607
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:17,589
I know it. You are the only one
that knows us both.

1608
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:20,425
Yeah.

1609
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:27,557
You wanna go?

1610
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,393
You wanna go to the game?

1611
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,854
Well, go ahead, 'cause I'm not going.

1612
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:36,900
Seventh and final game,
in what has been a classic series...

1613
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:39,444
Sweetie, I wouldn't have gone either.

1614
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:43,657
I mean, I would have liked to have gone,
but you probably wouldn't let me.

1615
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:49,579
You're doing the right thing.

1616
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:52,332
Oh, sweetie.

1617
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,336
There's the Chinese.

1618
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:00,590
I'm coming!

1619
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,807
- Okay, so that's gonna...
- Michelle.

1620
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:16,398
Andie, that wasn't the Chinese.
It's Mike.

1621
01:43:16,482 --> 01:43:19,609
- Mike!
- Yeah. What do I do? What do I do?

1622
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:21,152
Talk to him.

1623
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,446
Okay, okay.

1624
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:27,784
Okay.

1625
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,289
Mike?

1626
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:34,791
Mike!

1627
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:37,794
- Hi.
- Hi.

1628
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:43,884
So, what are you doing here?

1629
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,553
I don't know, exactly.

1630
01:43:47,138 --> 01:43:49,180
It was last night, I was...

1631
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:53,226
I was just lying there and trying to sleep.

1632
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:56,688
And you know that perfume
you sprayed on my pillow?

1633
01:43:57,732 --> 01:44:00,650
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, that smell is gone now.

1634
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,654
And, Michelle, I want it back.

1635
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,661
I don't know if you can have it back.

1636
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,833
Right.

1637
01:44:17,376 --> 01:44:18,543
Yeah.

1638
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:20,337
Okay.

1639
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:26,176
But I'm willing to consider it.

1640
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,262
Okay. Yeah.

1641
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:32,766
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

1642
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:35,101
Hi. Hi.

1643
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,111
Oh, my God!

1644
01:44:47,949 --> 01:44:51,242
- We could...
- I remember where you live.

1645
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:57,707
Who needs men?

1646
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:03,713
Ladies, frost yourselves.

1647
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,055
And cut it! Very nice!

1648
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:16,393
Okay, let's go. One more.
Right away, people.

1649
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:19,980
We'll keep working on it.
Tim, can I see playback?

1650
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:21,439
Open me, Ben.

1651
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:25,151
- Please, break my binding. Please!
- Jesus, get that out of here, man.

1652
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:29,489
- You might want to read this.
- No, thanks.

1653
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:31,574
Okay.

1654
01:45:32,243 --> 01:45:34,577
"I've lost a guy and I don't know why.

1655
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:36,746
"What went wrong?

1656
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,623
"When I started writing
this month's column,

1657
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:42,252
"I wanted to commit those certain,
silly dating faux pas.

1658
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:43,712
"What I didn't realize

1659
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:47,298
"was that I was making
the biggest mistake of all. "

1660
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:50,010
Here. Trust me.

1661
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:52,679
Read it.

1662
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:11,114
Come on set.

1663
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:23,460
Andie Anderson.

1664
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:36,806
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Holy crap!

1665
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:39,184
- Where's Andie Anderson?
- She's not here.

1666
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,602
- Where is she?
- She quit.

1667
01:46:40,686 --> 01:46:42,145
She's got an interview in Washington.

1668
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,189
- When's she leaving?
- Today.

1669
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:46,316
- When?
- Well, like, now.

1670
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,364
- You're not a therapist, are you?
- Oh, no.

1671
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:55,867
Good job, though.

1672
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:00,163
You owe me 300 bucks.

1673
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:19,557
Andie!

1674
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,250
Andie!

1675
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:31,629
- Ben!
- Pull over, we need to talk!

1676
01:48:32,173 --> 01:48:34,424
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1677
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:37,427
If that's what it takes, yeah!
Now pull over the cab!

1678
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,556
Sir? Excuse me, sir.
Could you please pull the car over?

1679
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,684
We're in the middle of a bridge, lady.
I can't pull the car over here.

1680
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:47,979
Okay, well, then do you have an ashtray
or something I can throw up in?

1681
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:49,606
Hey, lady!

1682
01:48:54,486 --> 01:48:56,279
Watch it, broad!

1683
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:59,157
- What the hell was that?
- Is this true?

1684
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:01,826
Ben, please.

1685
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:05,622
Is this true
or are you just trying to sell magazines?

1686
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:10,835
I meant every word.

1687
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,798
Well, where are you going?

1688
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:19,844
- I have an interview.
- Yeah, in Washington. I know.

1689
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:26,351
Where are you going?

1690
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:31,856
Ben it's the only place I can go
and write what I want to write.

1691
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,235
No, I'm not buying that.

1692
01:49:35,486 --> 01:49:37,403
You can write anywhere.

1693
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:41,366
I think you're running away.

1694
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:44,327
Why don't you save your mind games
for your next bet, okay?

1695
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:46,371
I am not running away.

1696
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:49,874
Bullshit.

1697
01:49:57,508 --> 01:49:58,841
Excuse me?

1698
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:03,638
You heard me.

1699
01:50:06,976 --> 01:50:08,351
Bullshit.

1700
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:13,481
Hey, lady, what do you wanna do?

1701
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,734
Take the lady's luggage
back to her place.

1702
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:19,070
She has alternate transportation.

1703
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:24,200
You calling my bluff?

1704
01:50:25,661 --> 01:50:27,328
You bet I am.

1705
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:49,100
- Look who made the trip with me.
- It's our love fern!

1706
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:52,353
Oh, Benny Boo-Boo Boo-Boo-Boo!

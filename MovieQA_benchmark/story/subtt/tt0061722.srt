1
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:22,311


2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,419


3
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:31,614
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to
begin our descent into Los Angeles.

4
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:35,722
The sound you have just heard is
landing gear locking into place.

5
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:39,435
The Los Angeles weather is clear,
temperature 72.

6
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:44,295
We expect to make our four hours
eighteen minutes flight on schedule.

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,404
We enjoyed having you on board and look
forward to see you again in the near future.

8
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,051
Attention, please! Passengers in this
area is limited to 3 minutes on leave.

9
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:03,221
Please do not leave your cart unattended.

10
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,702
Hey, What's the matter?

11
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,832
The guests are all downstairs, Ben.
They're all waiting to see you.

12
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,423
Look, Dad, Could you explain to them
that I have to be alone for a while?

13
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,051
These are all our good friends, Ben.

14
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:42,140
Most of them have known you since -
well - practically since you were born.

15
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:43,767
What is it, Ben?

16
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,437
I'm just -

17
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:48,648
- worried?

18
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:54,029
Well -

19
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:55,906
About what?

20
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,700
I guess - about my future.

21
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:02,705
What about it?

22
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:08,962
I don't know.  I want it to be -

23
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:11,423
To be what?

24
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,761
Different.

25
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:21,330
Is anything wrong?
No, No, we're just on our way downstairs!

26
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,061
The Carlsons' are here.

27
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,335
They are? Come on.

28
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,775
They came all the way from Tarzana.

29
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,319
Come on, let's get cracking.

30
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,448
It's a wonderful thing to have
so many devoted friends.

31
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,348
Hey - there's our award winning scholar.

32
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:39,267
We're all very proud of you, Ben.

33
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:40,226
Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

34
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,062
Is that the new car out there?
The little red Wop job?

35
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,647
That's Ben's graduation present.

36
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,357
Won't have much trouble picking
them up in that, will you?

37
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,337
So?

38
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,235
The girls, the chicks, the teeny boppers.

39
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,280
I think Ben has gotten beyond the
teeny bopper stage. Haven't you, Ben?

40
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:52,344
Yes, madam.

41
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:56,724
Excuse me. I think I'd just like to
check something on the car for a minute.

42
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,774
Here's the track star.
How are you, track star?

43
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:04,962
Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

44
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:08,633
I want to get a drink and then I want
to hear all about that thing you won.
That Hoppermanaward.

45
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:09,342
Helpingham.

46
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,241
Helpingham! Right! You wait right here.

47
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,714
Ben - we're all so proud of you.
Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.

48
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,945
What are you going to do now?

49
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,614
I was going to go upstairs for a minute -

50
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:31,951
No - I meant with your future, Your life.

51
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,328
Well - that's a little hard to say -

52
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,329
Ben!

53
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,436
Excuse me.
Mr. McQuire

54
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:39,439
Ben.

55
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,775
Mr. McQuire.

56
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,070
Come on with me for a minute.
I want to talk to you.

57
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,739
Excuses, John.

58
00:05:57,793 --> 00:06:02,339
I just want to say on word to you,
just one word.

59
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:04,613
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,594
Are you listening?
Yes I am.

61
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:08,722
Plastics.

62
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,373
Exactly how do you mean?

63
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:18,170
There is a great future in plastics.
Think about it. Will you think about it?

64
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:19,150
Yes, I will.

65
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:22,070
Enough said. That's a deal.

66
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:27,534
Here he is now. Here's Ben.
Excuse me just a minute -

67
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:32,227
Listen everybody, I want you all be quite.

68
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:37,796
I got Ben's college book here. I just want
we enjoy some wonderful things about Ben.

69
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:40,048
Be quiet, Please!

70
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,074
Captain of the cross country team
Head of the bating court

71
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:49,643
Associate editor of the college news paper
"New Junior here", Manager of "Junior and Senior"

72
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:29,396
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?

73
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,086
It's down the hall.

74
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,379
How are you, Benjamin?

75
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:38,739
Fine, thank you, Mrs Robinson.
The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.

76
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,159
Such a pleasent room.

77
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:46,748
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean
to be rude but, I am -

78
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:49,001
Is there an ashtray, thank you?

79
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:51,462
No.

80
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:54,757
Oh - I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.

81
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:04,769
Is it a girl?

82
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:07,397
Is what a girl?

83
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:10,483
Whatever it is upsetting you.

84
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:15,969
Oh - no. I'm just sort of disturbed
about things. In general.

85
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:17,491
That's right.

86
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:24,666
Well, congratulations!
Thank you!

87
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:32,592
Oh, Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What?

88
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:34,364
Will you take me home?
What?

89
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:36,471
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?

90
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:42,895
Here, you take it.
Do you know how to work a foreign shift?

91
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:47,400
You don't?
No.

92
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,073
Let's go.

93
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:20,479
Thank you.
Right.

94
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,088
Will you come in, please?
What?

95
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:45,695
I like you to come in till
I get the lights on.

96
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,362
What for?

97
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,011
Because I don't feel safe
until I get the lights on.

98
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,158
Would you mind walking ahead of
me to the sun porch.

99
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:12,370
I feel funny about
coming into a dark house.

100
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,165
But it's light there.
Please.

101
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:41,987
What do you drink? Bourbon?

102
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,805
Look, Mrs Robinson, I drove you home.
I was glad to do it.

103
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,183
But I have some things on my mind.
Can you understand that?

104
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,164
Yes.
All right.

105
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:53,417
What do you drink?

106
00:10:56,503 --> 00:11:00,278
Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this way, but
I don't want to be left alone in this house.

107
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:03,094
Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.

108
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:06,389
When is he coming back?
I don't know.

109
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,476
Drink?
No.

110
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,817
Are you always this much
afraid of being alone?
Yes.

111
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,029
Well, why can't you just lock
the doors and go to bed?

112
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,114
I'm very nuerotic.

113
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:37,174
May I ask you a question?

114
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,303
What do you think of me?

115
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:42,305
What do you mean?

116
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:45,976
You've known me nearly all of your life.
You must have formed some opinion.

117
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:50,397
Well - I've always thought that
you were a very - nice - person.

118
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,777
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

119
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:00,701
What?
Did you know that?

120
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,496
Look - I think I should be going.

121
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,269
Sit down, Benjamin.

122
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:08,522
Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so,

123
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,524
this conversation is getting a little strange.

124
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:13,319
Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will
be here any minute and...

125
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:14,508
No.
What?

126
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,762
My husband will be back quite late.
He should be gone for several hours.

127
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:21,808
Oh my God.

128
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:25,019
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

129
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,521
What's wrong?

130
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:29,712
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
I mean you didn't expect -

131
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:30,776
What?

132
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,404
I mean - you didn't really think that
I would do something like that.

133
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:35,198
Like what?

134
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,700
What do you think?
Well, I don't know.

135
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:41,017
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson.

136
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:45,605
Here we are, you've got me into your house.
You give me a drink. You put on music.

137
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,108
Now you start opening up
your personal life to me

138
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:49,985
and tell me your husband
won't be home for hours.

139
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:53,426
So?
Mrs. Robinson, you are
trying to seduce me.

140
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:57,890
Aren't you?

141
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:02,541
Well, no. I hadn't thought of it.
I feel rather flattered -

142
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:04,647
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
me for what I just said?

143
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,003
It's all right.

144
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:08,005
It's not all right, it's the worst
thing I've ever said to anyone.

145
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,111
Sit down.

146
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,510
Please forgive me. Because I like you.

147
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:15,117
I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.

148
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:16,682
It's all right. Now finish your drink.

149
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,684
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
that I said that to you.

150
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:20,916
Forget it right now. Finish your drink.

151
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:26,213
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

152
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,700
Her portrait?
Yes.

153
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:33,847
No.

154
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:37,434
We had it done last Christmas.
Would you like to see it?
Very much.

155
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,524
Here is Elaine's room.

156
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:52,493
Elaine certainly is an
attractive girl, isn't she?

157
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:57,811
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

158
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,417
Benjamin?
Yes?

159
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:04,506
Will you come here a minute?
Over there?sure

160
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:14,705
Will you unzip my dress? I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.

161
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,001
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

162
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:21,713
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you -
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.

163
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,675
Benjamin - you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm -

164
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,322
Come on. It's hard for me to reach.

165
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,124
Thank you.
Right.

166
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,025
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

167
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,402
Then why do you keep running away?

168
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,820
Because you're going to bed.

169
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,301
I don't think I should be up here.

170
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,515
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Yes, I have. But I just -

171
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:53,728
Look - what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What if he did?

172
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,418
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?

173
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:57,003
Don't you think he trusts us together?

174
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:57,962
Of course he does.

175
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,756
But he might get the wrong idea.
Anyone might.

176
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,757
I don't see why.

177
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,010
I'm twice as old as you are.
How could anyone think......

178
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,012
But they would! Don't you see?

179
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,889
Benjamin - I'm not trying to seduce you.

180
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,766
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson.

181
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,725
This is difficult for me.

182
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,687
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?

183
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,127
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

184
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:16,733
I'm going home now.
I apologize for what I said.

185
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,736
I hope you can forget it.

186
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,425
But I'm going home right now.

187
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,618
Benjamin?
Yes.

188
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:29,081
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.

189
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:31,625
I really don't want to put this on again.
Won't you bring it up?

190
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:34,316
Where is it?
On the table in the hall.

191
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:41,803
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm in the bathroom.

192
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,326
Well here's the purse.

193
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:44,744
Could you bring it up?

194
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:48,602
Well I'll hand it to you. Come to
the railing and I'll hand it up.

195
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:51,147
Benjamin - I am getting pretty
tired of all this suspicion.

196
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,816
Now if you won't do me a simple favor,

197
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,338
I don't know what.

198
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:58,030
I'm putting it on the top step.

199
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:01,930
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop
acting that way and bring me the purse?

200
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:07,603
I'm putting it here by the door.

201
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:10,314
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.

202
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:15,111
All right. Put it in Elaine's room where we were.
Right.

203
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:28,939
Oh, God!
Let me out!

204
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,234
Don't be nervous.
Get away from that door.

205
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,194
Let me say something first.
Jesus Christ!

206
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,113
Benjamin, I want you to know
I'm available to you.

207
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:36,740
If you want sleep with me this time.

208
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:37,366
Oh my Christ!

209
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,742
If you want sleep with me this time

210
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:42,267
I want you to know you can call me up any time
you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.

211
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,624
Do you understand what I said?
Let me out!

212
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:47,502
Benjamin, Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!

213
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,589
Because I find you very attractive
and any time you want-

214
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:51,694
Oh, Jesus!

215
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,669
Is that Ben's car in front?
Yes, Sir!

216
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:13,469
I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson home.
She wanted me to drive her home so I -
I drove her home.

217
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,013
Well. I appreciate it.

218
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:20,435
She's upstairs. She wanted me to
wait down here till you got home.

219
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:25,232
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Yes, sir.

220
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,279
Congratulations!
Thank you!

221
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:34,534
It looks like you need a refill.
Oh no. I got to go home.

222
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:39,435
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.

223
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,837
No. No - I'm just - I'm just a little worried about
my future. I'm a little upset about my future.

224
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:48,758
Come on. Let's have a nightcap together.

225
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:51,553
Scotch?
Bourbon.

226
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:59,562
Ben - how old are you now?

227
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:02,941
20. I'll be 21 next week.

228
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:16,414
That's a hell of a good age to be.

229
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:22,546
Thank you.
Thank you very much!

230
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:37,146
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben -
Sir?

231
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:42,444
You'll never be young again.
I know.

232
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,165
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?

233
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:01,090
How long have we known each other now?

234
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:12,144
How long have you and I known each other?
How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Quite a while.

235
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,364
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.

236
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:28,746
In many ways I feel as though
you were my own son.

237
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:30,289
Thank you.

238
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:40,759
So I hope you won't mind my giving
you a friendly piece of advice.

239
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:43,220
I'd like to hear it.

240
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:57,486
Ben - I think - I think you ought to be taking it
a little easier right now than you seem to be.

241
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:05,871
Sow a few wild oats. Take things as they come.
Have a good time with the girls and so forth.

242
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,539
Don't get up.

243
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:22,076
I was just telling Ben here he ought to sow
a few wild oats. Have a good time while
he can. You think that's sound advice?

244
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,182
Yes, I do.

245
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,226
I've got to go.

246
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:34,173
You have yourself a few fillings this summer.
I bet you're quite a ladies' man.

247
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:35,070
Oh no.

248
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:45,478
What? You look to me like the kind of guy that
has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you
like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?

249
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:46,833
Yes, he does.

250
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:52,652
Oh say - Elaine gets down
from Berkeley on Saturday.
Oh yes.

251
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:55,093
I wish you give her a call.
I will.

252
00:20:56,302 --> 00:21:00,661
Benjamin? Benjamin?
Yes.

253
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:04,437
Thank you for taking me home.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

254
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:12,988
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please
for this afternoon's feature attraction.

255
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:18,369
Hey, over there! Yes, I mean you!
Your attention please!

256
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,584
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?

257
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:29,861
Listen, I'm going to ask a big round of applause
to bring this boy out here, all right?

258
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:38,308
Wait a minute, let me amend that, to bring this young
man out here, because today he is 21 years old.

259
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:41,374
Come on, let's get on with the show!

260
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,480
Hang on a minute, I got a few words to say -

261
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:47,110
You always do.
ah, ah! what's talking

262
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:50,467
Dad, could we just talk about this for a second?

263
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:53,283
I can't hold them much longer, Ben.
You better get out here.

264
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,160
I'd like to discuss this.

265
00:21:55,577 --> 00:21:59,019
This boy - I'm sorry - this young man -
is soon to continue his education

266
00:21:59,123 --> 00:22:02,731
as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar

267
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:07,174
But before he does - before he does -

268
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,575
You're disappointing them, Ben.
You're disappointing them.

269
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,868
Dad - can you listen -

270
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:15,037
I'll give you ten seconds

271
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:19,333
He is going to give us a practical
demonstration of what I feel safe

272
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,316
in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present

273
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,070
And it better work or I'm out
over two hundred bucks.

274
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:31,993
Ok, let's herald now for - Benjamin Braddock!

275
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:38,584
Come on, let's herald now!

276
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:42,693
Folks, this remarkable young man is going to
perform for you some spectacular and amazing
feats of daring in water that is over 6 feet deep.

277
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:46,238
is going to perform for you some spectacular

278
00:22:46,343 --> 00:22:52,224
and amazing feats of daring in water
that is over 6 feet deep

279
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,101
Hello.

280
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,774
I don't quite know how to put this -
Benjamin?

281
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:56,009
Look, I was thinking about that time after the party -

282
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:56,885
Where are you?

283
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,680
I was wondering if I could
buy you a drink or something.

284
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:00,702
Where are you?

285
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:04,581
Uh - The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?

286
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:11,381
No. Now I know it's pretty
late and if you'd rather -
Give me an hour.

287
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:13,800
What?
I'll be there in an hour.

288
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,614
Can I help you, sir!

289
00:26:48,198 --> 00:26:53,120
What?  Oh - no - I'm just -
Are you here for an affair, sir?

290
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,647
What?
The Singleman party, sir?

291
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:03,110
Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.

292
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:05,134
Ahh - thank you.

293
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:24,009
Hello.
Hello.

294
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:27,096
You must be one of the Poets.
No - actually I'm not -

295
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,828
I'd like you to know my sister,
Miss DeWitte -

296
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:32,101
How do you do?
How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

297
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:33,520
- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

298
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:35,522
Oh, sorry.
Fine, thank you.

299
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,441
That's Jeffrey, of course.
Of course.

300
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:40,110
I didn't get your name, sir.
Benjamin Braddock, sir.

301
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:43,114
Braddock - Braddock?
Yes, but I'm afraid -

302
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:48,349
I'll find your table in a moment.
Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.

303
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:52,103
No - actually I'm just
looking for a friend.

304
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:55,503
Oh, but I don't understand.
I'm not with your party - I'm sorry.

305
00:27:55,607 --> 00:28:00,404
Hey - I don't get it.
I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr. Braniff.

306
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,755
Hello, Benjamin.
Oh. Hello.

307
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,842
May I sit down?
Of course.

308
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,094
Thank you.

309
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,515
How are you?
Very well. Thank you.

310
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,231
May I have a drink?
A drink?  Of course.

311
00:29:12,902 --> 00:29:14,487
He didn't see me.

312
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:18,241
Waiter! I will have a martini.
Yes, madam.

313
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:23,518
You don't have to be
so nervous, you know.

314
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:26,104
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous.

315
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:29,212
I mean it's - it's pretty hard
to be suave when you're -

316
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:31,715
Did you get us a room?
What?

317
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:34,426
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.

318
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:40,517
Do you want to?
Well, I don't. I mean I could or we could just talk.

319
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:45,022
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No, I'll get it.

320
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,086
Do you want to get it now?

321
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:49,443
-Now?
-Yes.

322
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:53,823
Well - I don't know.
Why don't you get it.

323
00:29:53,948 --> 00:29:57,327
Why don't I get it? Well, I will then.
If you'll excuse me.

324
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,642
Yes sir?

325
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:21,146
A room. I'd like a room, please.

326
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:23,023
Single room or double room?

327
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,233
A single. Just for myself, please.

328
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:26,902
Will you sign the register, please?

329
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:34,619
Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No, Nothing.

330
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:46,049
Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?

331
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:49,427
Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

332
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:51,325
Where is it?
What?

333
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,056
Where is your luggage?

334
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,542
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.

335
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:05,216
-Oh no. I mean I'd rather not go
to the trouble of bringing it all in.

336
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,803
I just have a toothbrush.
I can get it myself. If that's all right.

337
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,848
Of course.
I'll have a porter show you the room.

338
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,519
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself.

339
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:20,128
I just have the toothbrush to carry up
and I think I can manage it myself.

340
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,340
Whatever you say, sir.
Thank you!

341
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,201
Mrs. Robinson.
Yes?

342
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,725
For you.
Thank you.

343
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:37,961
Hello?

344
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:39,859
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?

345
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:42,028
It's Benjamin.
Yes?

346
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:43,738
Benjamin Braddock.

347
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:46,116
Benjamin, where are you?

348
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:48,911
Can you look through the glass.

349
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,835
Can you see me now?
Yes, I can.

350
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:59,151
I got a single room.
That's fine.

351
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:02,906
But there's one thing. The desk clerk
seemed to be a little bit suspicious.

352
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,450
I don't know what their policy is.

353
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:06,952
Well - do you want to go up first?

354
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:08,516
Yes - I think that would be good.

355
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:10,039
I'll be up in five minutes.

356
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:11,165
Well - goodbye then -

357
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,126
Benjamin.
Yes?

358
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,961
Isn't there something
you want to tell me?

359
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:16,525
To tell you?
Yes.

360
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:21,552
Well, I want you to know how
much I appreciate this, really.

361
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:23,345
The room number.
What?

362
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,848
The room number, Benjamin.
I think you ought to tell me that.

363
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:27,579
Oh? You're absolutely right.

364
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:33,044
It's 562.
Thank you.

365
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:40,052
You're welcome. Well - I'll see
you later, Mrs. Robinson.

366
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:49,187
Check, please.

367
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:52,357
I've got it.

368
00:32:52,524 --> 00:32:54,443
I say I've got it.
Sir?

369
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,946
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.

370
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:59,991
Yes.  Well - goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.

371
00:34:51,992 --> 00:34:55,996
Hello, Benjamin.
Hello, Mrs Robinson.

372
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,084
Benjamin.
Yes?

373
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:40,004
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure.

374
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:45,990
Shall I - I mean shall I just stand here?
I mean - I don't know what you want me to do.

375
00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:48,367
Why don't you watch?
Oh, sure. Thank you.

376
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:50,578
Will you bring me a hanger?
What?

377
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:53,060
A hanger.
Oh, yes.

378
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:01,695
Wood?
What?

379
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,885
Wood or wire?  They have both.

380
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:06,659
Either one will be fine.
Okay.

381
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:17,755
Thank you!

382
00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:28,100
Will you help me with this, please?
Certainly.

383
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:33,898
Thank you.
You're welcome.

384
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,069
Benjamin, Would this be
easier for you in the dark?

385
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,676
Mrs. Robinson - I can't do this.
You what?

386
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,177
This is all terribly wrong.

387
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,993
Do you find me undesirable?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.

388
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,496
I think - I think you're the most
attractive of all my parents' friends.

389
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,082
I mean that. I found you desirable, but I-

390
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,460
For god's sake, can you
imange my parents?

391
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:13,588
Can you imange what they will say if
they just saw we are in this room like now?

392
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,841
What will they say?
I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson.

393
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:17,509
But for god's sake.

394
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,678
They brought me up, they
made a good life for me.

395
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:21,389
And I think they deserve better than this.

396
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:24,475
I think they deserve a little better than
jumping into bed with their partner's wife.

397
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,604
Are you afraid of me?
Oh, no, you are missing the point.

398
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:33,757
Look, maybe we could do something else together.
Mrs. Robinson, would you like to go to a movie.

399
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:39,492
Can I ask you a personal question?
I should do anything you want.

400
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:41,912
Is this your first time?
Is this - what?

401
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,289
It is, isn't it?
It is your first time.

402
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:47,126
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
That's really a laugh. Ha ha.

403
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,921
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?

404
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:52,173
It's nothing to be ashamed of -
Wait a minute!

405
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:53,967
On your first time -
Who said it was my first time.

406
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:54,968
that you're afraid -
Wait a minute.

407
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,179
- of bring - inadequate -  I mean just because
you happen to be inadequate in one way -

408
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:58,284
INADEQUATE!

409
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:04,500
Don't move.

410
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,669
Ben - what are you doing?

411
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:13,326
Well - I would say that I'm just
drifting. - here - in the pool.

412
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,431
Why?

413
00:43:15,265 --> 00:43:18,227
Well - it's very comfortable -
just to drift here.

414
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:22,607
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.

415
00:43:22,857 --> 00:43:24,839
Would you  mind telling me then -

416
00:43:24,943 --> 00:43:29,114
what were those four years of
college for?  What was the point
of all that hard work?

417
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:30,637
You got me.

418
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,618
Now listen, Ben.

419
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:41,670
I think it's a very good thing that a young
man - after he's done some very good work -

420
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:45,424
should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself,

421
00:43:45,716 --> 00:43:48,553
and lie around, and drink beer and so on.

422
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,431
But after a few weeks

423
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:56,499
I believe that person would want to take
some stock in himself and his situation

424
00:43:56,604 --> 00:43:59,023
and start to think about
getting off his ass.

425
00:43:59,524 --> 00:44:01,526
The Robinson's are here.

426
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,075
Hi, Ben.  What are you doing
with yourself these days?

427
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,746
Oh, not too much. Taking it easy.

428
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:16,042
That's what I'd do if I could.
Nothing wrong with that.

429
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,817
Hey, Ben, Elaine's coming
down from Berkeley soon.

430
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:22,821
I want you to call her up this time.
I will.

431
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:25,928
Because I just think you two would
hit it off real well together.

432
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:29,140
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

433
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:36,065
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Hello, Benjamin.

434
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:55,336
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.

435
00:44:56,546 --> 00:45:00,238
Benjamin, Darling.
I'm going to ask you something

436
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:03,554
but you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

437
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:05,139
What?

438
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:09,727
Well I'm going to ask you what
you do when you go off at night.

439
00:45:11,646 --> 00:45:12,606
When I go off?

440
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:15,630
You don't have to tell me if
you don't want to.

441
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,736
No, I do. I want to tell you.

442
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:20,761
I drive around.

443
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:23,847
What else?
Nothing else.

444
00:45:23,952 --> 00:45:27,643
Well you don't drive around from midnight
until noon the next day, Benjamin.

445
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:28,749
Oh, no.

446
00:45:28,874 --> 00:45:32,336
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?

447
00:45:32,753 --> 00:45:35,423
Meet someone?
Why did you say that?

448
00:45:35,757 --> 00:45:37,947
Well this is your business,
I won't play games.

449
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:42,556
No wait. Wait, I don't meet anyone,
Mother. But why did you say that?

450
00:45:42,765 --> 00:45:46,123
Benjamin, I don't want to pry
into your affairs,

451
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:49,564
but I'd rather you didn't say
anything at all than be dishonest.

452
00:45:50,064 --> 00:45:51,629
Goodnight.
Well, wait.

453
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:52,838
Wait a minute.

454
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:54,945
Will you wait a minute, please?

455
00:45:58,491 --> 00:46:03,955
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say
a few words to each other first this time?

456
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:07,167
I don't think we have much
to say to each other.

457
00:46:12,548 --> 00:46:16,761
Look, for a month, all we ever do is to
come up here and leap into bed together.

458
00:46:17,262 --> 00:46:18,763
Are you tired of it?

459
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:24,061
I'm not. No. But do you think
we could liven it up with a
conversation for change?

460
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:25,667
Well what do you want to talk about?

461
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:27,773
Anything.  Anything at all.

462
00:46:28,149 --> 00:46:31,695
Do you want to tell me about
some of your college experiences?

463
00:46:31,945 --> 00:46:33,447
Oh my God.

464
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:39,370
Think of another topic.

465
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:50,779
How about art.

466
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:53,156
Art. That's a good subject.

467
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,345
You start it off.

468
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:57,244
You start it off. I don't know
anything about it.

469
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,163
What do you want
to know about it.

470
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:02,062
Are you interested more in modern
art or more in classical art.

471
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:03,167
Neither.

472
00:47:03,272 --> 00:47:05,170
You're not interested in art?
No.

473
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:07,360
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I don't.

474
00:47:07,777 --> 00:47:10,488
Now look, we are going to do this thing.
we are going to have a conversation.

475
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:12,574
Tell me what you did today.

476
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:16,078
I got up.

477
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:19,185
I fixed breakfast for my husband.

478
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,145
There!

479
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:23,544
There's something we could have
a conversation about Your husband!

480
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:25,359
Him?

481
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:29,322
I mean everything. I don't know
anything about how you work this.

482
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:31,971
What do you say to him when
you leave the house at night?

483
00:47:32,096 --> 00:47:33,556
Nothing. He's asleep.

484
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:36,768
Always? Doesn't he wake up
when you come home?

485
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:40,564
We have seperated bedrooms.

486
00:47:42,774 --> 00:47:46,800
So you don't - I mean I don't
like to seem like I'm prying

487
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:50,491
but I guess you don't sleep
together or anything.
No we don't.

488
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,264
Well how long has
this been going on.

489
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,747
Forgot it.
Wait a minute,  Why do you hurry?

490
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,979
See if you can guess.

491
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,460
Well I can't.

492
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,858
Think real hard, Benjamin.

493
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,507
I can't see why you did, unless

494
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,552
You didn't have to marry
him or anything, did you?

495
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:17,438
Don't tell Elaine.

496
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:20,671
Oh no.  You had to marry him
because you got pregnant?

497
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:22,486
Are you shocked?

498
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,846
Well I never thought of you and Mr.
Robinson as the kind of people who...

499
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,848
Oh, I know. Let's get to bed.

500
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:31,704
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

501
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:34,666
So how did it happen?

502
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:35,730
What?

503
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:39,839
Mrs. Robinson, I mean do you feel like telling me
what were the circumstances?

504
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:41,841
Not particularly.

505
00:48:42,258 --> 00:48:44,636
Was he a law student at the time?

506
00:48:45,762 --> 00:48:47,764
And you were a student also.

507
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:53,187
At college.
Yes.

508
00:48:53,354 --> 00:48:55,356
What was your major?

509
00:48:59,778 --> 00:49:02,802
Benjamin, why are you asking
me all these questions?

510
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,159
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.

511
00:49:05,284 --> 00:49:10,915
Now what was your
major subject at college?
Art.

512
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,083
Art?

513
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:15,796
But I thought you...

514
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:24,514
I guess you kind of lost interest
in it over the years then.

515
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:27,475
Kind of.

516
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:32,398
Well how did it happen?

517
00:49:32,564 --> 00:49:34,900
What?
You and Mr. Robinson.

518
00:49:35,693 --> 00:49:36,652
How do you think.

519
00:49:36,778 --> 00:49:38,404
I mean did he take you
up to his room with him?

520
00:49:38,655 --> 00:49:40,135
Did you go to a hotel?

521
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,680
Benjamin, what does
it possibly matter?

522
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:43,890
I'm curious.

523
00:49:43,994 --> 00:49:45,892
We'd go to his car.

524
00:49:45,996 --> 00:49:49,271
Oh no. In the car you did it?

525
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,461
I don't think we were the first.

526
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:56,383
What kind of car was it?
What?

527
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,948
Do you remember the
make of the car?

528
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:01,660
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.

529
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:03,975
It was a Ford, Benjamin.

530
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:10,649
A Ford!  A Ford!  God damn it,
That's great! a Ford!

531
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,568
That's enough.

532
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,576
So old Elaine Robinson
got started in a Ford.

533
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:22,662
Don't talk about Elaine.

534
00:50:22,996 --> 00:50:24,373
Don't talk about Elaine?

535
00:50:24,915 --> 00:50:27,877
No.
Why not?

536
00:50:28,586 --> 00:50:30,150
Because I don't want you to.

537
00:50:30,254 --> 00:50:31,881
Why don't you?

538
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,591
I wish you'd tell me.

539
00:50:33,717 --> 00:50:35,177
There's nothing to tell.

540
00:50:35,385 --> 00:50:38,388
Well why is she a big taboo
subject all of a sudden?

541
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:43,624
Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date
and find out what the problem is.

542
00:50:43,728 --> 00:50:49,484
Benjamin, don't you ever take that
girl out. Do you understand that?

543
00:50:49,693 --> 00:50:51,487
Well look. I have no
intention of taking her out.

544
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:55,574
Good.

545
00:50:56,284 --> 00:50:58,202
I was just kidding around.

546
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,085
But why shouldn't I?

547
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:12,010
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.

548
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,866
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson.

549
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,514
Because I think I know what they are.

550
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:18,454
I'm not good enough for her
to associate with, am I?

551
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,811
I'm not good enough to
even talk about her, am I?

552
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,064
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it.

553
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:25,754
I'm good enough for you but I'm too
slimy to associate with your daughter.

554
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:28,904
That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?

555
00:51:41,793 --> 00:51:46,986
Yes
You go to hell. You go straight
to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

556
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:49,781
Do you think I'm proud of myself?
Do you think I'm proud of this?

557
00:51:49,885 --> 00:51:51,721
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.

558
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,185
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time
with a brokendown alcoholic!

559
00:51:58,103 --> 00:51:58,958
I see.

560
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,795
And if you think I come here for
any reason besides pure boredom,

561
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:03,401
then you're all wrong.

562
00:52:03,818 --> 00:52:07,676
Because, Mrs. Robinson, this is the sickest,
most perverted thing that ever happened to me.

563
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:10,283
And you do what you want
but I'm getting the hell out.

564
00:52:11,326 --> 00:52:13,787
Are you?
You're goddamn right I am.

565
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:20,024
That's how you feel about me.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.

566
00:52:20,128 --> 00:52:21,358
I won't start this.

567
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:24,216
What?
Don't start acting hurt.

568
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,573
Don't you expect me
to be a little hurt?

569
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:30,389
Mrs. Robinson, you lie here and tell me
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

570
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:32,141
Did I say that?

571
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:34,018
In some other words.

572
00:52:35,604 --> 00:52:39,504
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you
if that's the impression you got.

573
00:52:39,608 --> 00:52:42,361
Well two minutes ago you told me
I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

574
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,906
Now you say you're sorry
I got that impression.

575
00:52:45,198 --> 00:52:49,077
I didn't mean it.  I don't think
you'd be right for each other.

576
00:52:49,786 --> 00:52:52,790
But I would never say you weren't
as good a person as she is.

577
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:57,712
You wouldn't.
Of course I wouldn't.

578
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:03,802
What are you doing?

579
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:07,222
Well it's pretty obvious you
don't want me around any more.

580
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:16,191
Well look -
I was kind of upset there.

581
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:19,820
I'm sorry I said those things.

582
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:24,700
That's all right. I think I can
understand why I'm disgusting to you.

583
00:53:25,618 --> 00:53:32,626
Oh no. Look, I like you.
I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

584
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,422
But if it's sickening for you -
It's not!

585
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:43,805
I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the
one thing I have to look forward to.

586
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:47,476
You don't have to say that.

587
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:51,606
Well I wouldn't. I would
never say it if it wasn't true.

588
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:54,150
May I stay then?

589
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:58,947
Yes. Please. I want you to.

590
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:00,720
Thank you.

591
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:04,620
Well don't thank me,
because I want you to.

592
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:10,293
But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you?
I want you to promise me with that.

593
00:54:11,002 --> 00:54:14,903
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up.
It never occured to me to take her out.

594
00:54:15,007 --> 00:54:16,550
Then give me your word you won't.

595
00:54:17,802 --> 00:54:21,347
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.

596
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:24,705
All right, I promise, for christ's sake.

597
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,104
I promise I will never take
out Elaine Robinson.

598
00:54:29,815 --> 00:54:30,816
Thank you.

599
00:54:36,698 --> 00:54:38,366
Benjanmin.
Let's not talk about it.

600
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,829
Let's not talk at all.

601
00:55:18,286 --> 00:55:19,475
Elaine's back from school.

602
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:23,834
I think it might be a nice gesture
if you asked her out.

603
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:40,123
Suppose she's not good
enough for you, is that it?

604
00:55:40,228 --> 00:55:42,689
Look - Elaine Robinson and I
do not get along.

605
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:45,025
How do you know?
You haven't seen her since high school.

606
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:50,051
Suppose
your evenings, whatever
you do with them, are just too valuable.

607
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:51,615
That has nothing to do with it -

608
00:55:52,158 --> 00:55:54,056
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson

609
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,060
that you're just too busy every
evening - doing God knows what -

610
00:55:58,164 --> 00:56:00,167
Don't go on like this.

611
00:56:01,043 --> 00:56:04,630
If Benjamin absolutely
refuses to take her out -
I do.

612
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:10,011
- then I'll simply invite all the
Robinsons' over on Thursday.

613
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,945
Well, Braddock - it's about
time you got around to this.

614
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,129
Hello.

615
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:48,388
Come on in. I'm afraid the young
lady isn't quite ready yet.

616
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,078
What would you say to a short one?

617
00:56:51,182 --> 00:56:54,102
Scotch still your drink?
Bourbon.

618
00:57:09,912 --> 00:57:11,997
I'll see if she's ready.

619
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:26,389
Now listen, this was not my
idea. It was my father's idea.

620
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:29,601
Benjamin, I thought I made myself
perfectly clear about this.

621
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:32,959
Look, we'll go out to dinner and
have a drink and I'll bring her back.

622
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:36,212
Because it was either that or a
dinner party for the two families.

623
00:57:36,316 --> 00:57:38,819
And I'm afriad I couldn't quite
handle that, if you don't mind.

624
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:44,138
Look, I have no intention of ever taking
your precious daughter out again in her life.

625
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:45,639
So don't get upset about it.

626
00:57:45,744 --> 00:57:49,832
But I am. I'm extremely
upset about it, Benjamin.

627
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:54,420
Hello.
Hello.

628
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:57,194
Well, I want you to keep your wits about you tonight.

629
00:57:57,298 --> 00:58:01,345
You never know what tricks Ben
picked up back there in the East.

630
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:15,736
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Yes.

631
00:58:17,196 --> 00:58:19,740
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.

632
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,040
Are you going to graduate school?
No.

633
00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:36,551
Do you always drive like this?
Yes.

634
01:00:00,937 --> 01:00:01,938
Sit down.

635
01:00:16,955 --> 01:00:18,958
Why don't you watch the show?

636
01:00:23,129 --> 01:00:26,132
Benjamin, do you dislike
me for some reason?

637
01:00:26,341 --> 01:00:28,009
No - why should I?

638
01:00:29,469 --> 01:00:30,679
I don't know.

639
01:00:39,356 --> 01:00:41,858
You're missing a great effect here.

640
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,447
Are you like that?

641
01:00:49,867 --> 01:00:51,160
Could you do it?

642
01:01:14,603 --> 01:01:16,439
Stop.Hey!!!

643
01:01:25,616 --> 01:01:27,159
Elaine, I'm sorry.

644
01:01:30,413 --> 01:01:32,311
Will you take me home now?

645
01:01:32,415 --> 01:01:33,959
I'm sorry I took you in there.

646
01:01:34,292 --> 01:01:36,253
I think I'd better go
home now, please.

647
01:01:43,094 --> 01:01:45,763
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.

648
01:01:49,768 --> 01:01:52,771
I want to go home.
But could I just tell you this one thing?

649
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,673
What?
This whole idea, this date and everything.
It was my parents' idea.

650
01:01:57,777 --> 01:01:59,154
They forced me into it.

651
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:01,844
Oh - that's very nice of
you to tell me.

652
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:04,555
No.  What I mean is - that's
why I've been acting this way.

653
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,246
I'm not like this.
I hate myself like this.

654
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,649
Listen, could you just stop crying, please?

655
01:02:13,753 --> 01:02:14,984
No, I couldn't.

656
01:02:15,088 --> 01:02:17,090
But could you try?
No.

657
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:34,026
I've had this feeling ever
since I've graduated.

658
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,842
This kind of compulsion that
I have to be rude all the time.

659
01:02:36,946 --> 01:02:38,969
Do you know what I mean?

660
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,285
Yes, I do.

661
01:02:43,078 --> 01:02:44,851
It's like I've been playing
some kind of - game -

662
01:02:44,955 --> 01:02:47,082
but the rudes
don't make any sense to me.

663
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:49,961
They're being made up
by all the wrong people.

664
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:55,091
No, I mean no one makes them up,
they seem to have made themselves up.

665
01:02:57,469 --> 01:03:01,474
Hey - I wonder if I could request
you to turn that down a little?

666
01:03:52,447 --> 01:03:56,452
Would you like to come in?
I could make some coffee.

667
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:00,373
No, I mean - I wouldn't
want to wake anyone up.

668
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:03,668
We won't.  Let's go inside.

669
01:04:04,461 --> 01:04:06,964
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?

670
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:12,553
No, I was just thinking.
It's still early.

671
01:04:12,971 --> 01:04:15,640
We could do something,
go somewhere else.

672
01:04:17,392 --> 01:04:18,393
All right.

673
01:04:25,985 --> 01:04:27,466
Where we going?

674
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:30,469
I'm trying to think of where there's a place
to have a drink around here.

675
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:32,576
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?

676
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,475
What is the matter?

677
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:39,500
Nothing.  I'm just wondering
if they have a bar or not.

678
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,963
I mean let's go see. Let's
go see if they do or not.

679
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,572
Listen, Elaine, it seems to me
that there is a bar here.

680
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:48,573
I mean - as far as I know.

681
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,867
Of course there is. Look, the
Veranda Room, right there.

682
01:04:50,972 --> 01:04:51,973
Good evening.

683
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,371
Hello, how are you, sir?

684
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:55,977
Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

685
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:57,646
Hello again.

686
01:04:59,398 --> 01:05:02,359
Hi, Mr. Gladstone.
How are you this evening?

687
01:05:03,986 --> 01:05:04,987
Benjamin -

688
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,178
Let's get out of here, Elaine.
Let's go somewhere else.

689
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:09,889
Do they know you?
Of course not.

690
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:10,890
Good evening, sir.

691
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:12,454
Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.

692
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:16,459
Mr. Gladstone - how are you?

693
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:18,357
Benjamin, what's happening?

694
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:20,859
I don't know. They must think
I look like this guy Gladstone.

695
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,465
Hello, Mr. Brannif.

696
01:05:35,271 --> 01:05:36,773
Elaine, I like you.

697
01:05:37,399 --> 01:05:41,403
I like you so much.
Do you believe that?

698
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:47,785
Do you?
Yes.

699
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:55,586
You're the first - you're the first
thing for so long that I've liked.

700
01:05:56,462 --> 01:05:59,006
The first person
I could stand to be with.

701
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,304
My whole life is such a waste.

702
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:07,182
It's just nothing.

703
01:06:12,063 --> 01:06:14,607
I'm sorry.  I'll take you home now.

704
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:20,405
Benjamin - are you having
an affair with someone?

705
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:30,709
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That is not my business.

706
01:06:31,918 --> 01:06:33,378
It just happened.

707
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:39,177
It was just this thing that happened
along with everything else.

708
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,180
Can you understand that?

709
01:06:43,682 --> 01:06:48,312
Was she married or something?
Yes.

710
01:06:49,521 --> 01:06:53,526
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.

711
01:06:55,403 --> 01:06:58,198
Did they ever find out?
No.

712
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:07,291
And it's all over now.
Yes.

713
01:07:14,466 --> 01:07:15,592
I'm glad.

714
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,984
Can we do something tomorrow?
All right.

715
01:07:30,818 --> 01:07:33,300
During the day?  We'll go
for a drive or something.

716
01:07:33,404 --> 01:07:34,322
Okay.

717
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:37,200
You sure you really want to?
Yes.

718
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,183
Because I wouldn't want you to
do it unless you really wanted to!

719
01:07:40,287 --> 01:07:42,310
I do.
You do?

720
01:07:42,414 --> 01:07:44,792
Benjamin, I really do.

721
01:08:16,494 --> 01:08:17,787
Drive down the block.

722
01:08:18,622 --> 01:08:22,480
Mrs. Robinson, Elaine I have
a date. We're going for a drive.

723
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:24,587
Do exactly as I say.

724
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:34,806
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin

725
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:39,040
You are not to see Elaine again, ever.
Those are my orders. Is that clear?

726
01:08:39,145 --> 01:08:40,000
Mrs. Robinson, do you think -

727
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:42,211
I can makes things quite unpleasant.

728
01:08:42,315 --> 01:08:43,274
How?

729
01:08:43,942 --> 01:08:47,821
In order to keep Elaine away from you,
I am prepared to tell her everything.

730
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:52,493
I don't believe you.

731
01:08:53,411 --> 01:08:55,204
Then you'd better start believing me.

732
01:08:55,413 --> 01:08:57,415
I just don't believe you would do that.

733
01:08:58,416 --> 01:08:59,543
Try me.

734
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,087
Elaine! Elaine!
Benjamin?

735
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:22,610
Benjamin?
I'm coming up.
I'm not dressed yet.

736
01:09:23,278 --> 01:09:25,280
Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed.

737
01:09:25,405 --> 01:09:27,094
You've got to go over the back fence
and I'll meet you on the corner.

738
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:28,304
Benjamin, what's the matter?

739
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:29,702
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.

740
01:09:32,204 --> 01:09:34,853
Benjamin, Benjamin.
Elaine.

741
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:35,729
What are you doing?

742
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:38,315
Elaine, I have to tell you something.
What is it?

743
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,108
That woman.
What?

744
01:09:39,212 --> 01:09:41,319
The older woman we talked about.

745
01:09:41,423 --> 01:09:43,425
You mean the one who -
Yes, the married woman.

746
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,220
It wasn't just some woman -
What are you telling me?

747
01:09:46,345 --> 01:09:49,015
Benjamin, will you just tell
me what it is all about?

748
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:05,095
Oh, no.

749
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,703
Elaine -
Oh my God!

750
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:10,226
Please!
Get out of here!

751
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,206
Don't cry -

752
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,335
GET OUT!
GET OUT!

753
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:22,511
Goodbye, Benjamin.

754
01:12:20,644 --> 01:12:22,104
Say that again.

755
01:12:22,854 --> 01:12:25,316
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

756
01:12:28,986 --> 01:12:33,053
Ha...Ha... Well - Well - Well

757
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:34,618
What's happening?

758
01:12:35,035 --> 01:12:38,747
Ben says he and Elaine
are getting married.

759
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:41,938
I don't believe it.

760
01:12:42,043 --> 01:12:45,046
That's what he says. Right?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.

761
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:53,618
Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
We've got something to celebrate.

762
01:12:53,722 --> 01:12:55,454
No, I think you'll want
to wait on that.

763
01:12:55,558 --> 01:12:57,727
They don't know?
No - they don't.

764
01:12:57,852 --> 01:13:01,022
Well, when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.

765
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:04,005
Wait a minute. You talked
to Elaine this morning?

766
01:13:04,109 --> 01:13:05,945
No, she doesn't know about it.

767
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:09,136
You mean she doesn't know
that you're coming up to Berkeley?

768
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,452
No. Actually, she doesn't know
about us getting married yet.

769
01:13:12,911 --> 01:13:15,705
When did you two talk this over?
We haven't.

770
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:17,040
You haven't?

771
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:21,733
Ben, this whole idea
sounds pretty half-baked.

772
01:13:21,837 --> 01:13:25,550
No, it's not. It's completely baked.
It's a decision I've made.

773
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,136
But what makes you think
she wants to marry you?

774
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:31,306
She doesn't. To be perfectly
honest, she doesn't like me.

775
01:16:43,668 --> 01:16:46,213
You are student?
Not exactly.

776
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,132
What's not exactly?
- no.

777
01:16:49,425 --> 01:16:50,718
What are you then?

778
01:16:51,344 --> 01:16:53,346
Well, I'm just sort of traveling through.

779
01:16:55,348 --> 01:17:00,062
I like to know who's living in my house,
like to know what my boys are up to.

780
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:02,523
I'm not up too much.

781
01:17:04,525 --> 01:17:06,069
I'm just visiting.

782
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:10,740
I mean - I've always wanted to see Berkeley.

783
01:17:14,203 --> 01:17:16,351
You're not one of those agitators?
What?

784
01:17:16,455 --> 01:17:17,853
One of those outside agitators.
Oh - no.

785
01:17:17,957 --> 01:17:19,417
I hate that.
I won't stand for it.

786
01:18:58,361 --> 01:19:01,365
Well, how about this for a coincidence.

787
01:19:06,871 --> 01:19:08,873
I was wondering where
you were headed.

788
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,063
I'm meeting someone.

789
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,170
Ah. Where?

790
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,862
Where are you meeting this person?

791
01:19:17,967 --> 01:19:18,968
At the zoo.

792
01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:23,348
The Zoo. They have a pretty
good one here, do they?

793
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:26,768
I don't know, I've never seen it.

794
01:19:26,977 --> 01:19:28,937
Oh. Well, I haven't either.

795
01:19:31,357 --> 01:19:33,276
I might just ride out there with you.

796
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,242
Is that him over there?
No.

797
01:19:44,497 --> 01:19:47,667
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.

798
01:19:49,377 --> 01:19:51,546
Benjamin - I would like to know
what you're doing here.

799
01:19:51,755 --> 01:19:53,548
Here?  In Berkelely?
Yes.

800
01:19:54,091 --> 01:19:57,991
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter
Street, and I've been getting to some classes.

801
01:19:58,095 --> 01:19:58,950
But you're not enrolled.

802
01:19:59,055 --> 01:20:01,161
No, I just sit in.
They don't seem to mind.

803
01:20:01,265 --> 01:20:03,143
They've been very congenial about it.

804
01:20:03,268 --> 01:20:06,417
Benjamin - you're -
I don't know what to say.

805
01:20:06,521 --> 01:20:09,149
Maybe we could get together
some time and talk about it.

806
01:20:09,441 --> 01:20:10,943
Really incredible.

807
01:20:13,362 --> 01:20:15,031
Here he comes.
What?

808
01:20:15,281 --> 01:20:17,450
I've got a real feeling
that this is the fellow.

809
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:20,579
Elaine!

810
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:22,372
He certainly is a good walker.

811
01:20:23,374 --> 01:20:24,854
Am I late? I'm sorry.

812
01:20:24,959 --> 01:20:26,627
We thought you said by
the monkey house.

813
01:20:27,378 --> 01:20:29,964
This is Benjamin Braddock.
Carl Smith.

814
01:20:30,381 --> 01:20:32,175
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.

815
01:20:32,467 --> 01:20:34,636
Glad to meet you, Ben.
Great meeting you, Carl.

816
01:20:35,179 --> 01:20:36,347
Swell seeing you.

817
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:21,272
Who is this?

818
01:21:22,357 --> 01:21:25,151
I want to ask you a question. and I'm going.
Come in.

819
01:21:25,443 --> 01:21:27,988
No. I want to know why
you're here in Berkeley?

820
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:31,283
Because - I am.
Is it because I'm here?

821
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,703
What do you think?
I think it is.

822
01:21:35,163 --> 01:21:37,269
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!

823
01:21:37,373 --> 01:21:38,771
Well, I want you to leave.

824
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,252
Oh, look, I love you!

825
01:21:40,377 --> 01:21:43,172
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything?

826
01:21:43,589 --> 01:21:45,487
How could you possibly rape my mother?
What?

827
01:21:45,591 --> 01:21:46,279
I don't understand -

828
01:21:46,384 --> 01:21:49,366
I don't understand how you - how
anyone - could do a thing like that.
What did she say?

829
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:50,534
You got tell me what did she say.

830
01:21:50,638 --> 01:21:52,265
Why?
Because it isn't true.

831
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,267
Tell me.

832
01:21:54,393 --> 01:21:56,791
She said she was having a drink
in the hotel with a friend.

833
01:21:56,895 --> 01:22:01,254
You waited for her in the parking lot and told
her she was too drunk to drive home

834
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:03,757
and you would get her a room for the night.

835
01:22:03,862 --> 01:22:04,904
Then what?

836
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,178
Then you took her upstairs
and you raped her.

837
01:22:07,282 --> 01:22:09,284
Oh, no, no, no, that's not what happened.

838
01:22:09,576 --> 01:22:12,142
What happened was there
was this party at my parents.

839
01:22:12,246 --> 01:22:14,853
I drove your mother home -
I don't want to hear it.

840
01:22:14,957 --> 01:22:16,146
then we went upstairs
to see your portrait.

841
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,189
No - I no -
and when we got up in the room -

842
01:22:17,293 --> 01:22:19,483
She is my mother!
- she starts taking her her clothes off

843
01:22:19,588 --> 01:22:23,050
suddenly there she was without any
clothes on. I mean really naked.

844
01:22:39,193 --> 01:22:41,341
Oh, hello, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?

845
01:22:41,445 --> 01:22:42,905
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

846
01:22:43,197 --> 01:22:45,700
Screaming isn't all right.
Not in my house, it isn't.

847
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:47,869
It was just a visitor.
But it's all right now.

848
01:22:49,872 --> 01:22:51,290
What did you do to her?

849
01:22:51,457 --> 01:22:54,898
Look, she's all right. She's upset and
she screamed. But she's okay now.

850
01:22:55,002 --> 01:22:56,400
Shall I get the cops?
What?

851
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,173
I'll get the cops.
Hey, wait a minute.

852
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:02,511
Damned look, see, here
she's having some water.

853
01:23:03,804 --> 01:23:05,764
Now there's no need
for the cops or anything.

854
01:23:06,265 --> 01:23:08,768
All right, boys, I think you can
get back to your rooms now.

855
01:23:11,396 --> 01:23:13,565
I don't think we'll have
any more of this agitation.

856
01:23:14,983 --> 01:23:16,777
Will we, Braddock?
No, sir.

857
01:23:20,406 --> 01:23:21,866
I want you out of here.

858
01:23:22,366 --> 01:23:24,890
What do you mean?
You heard me. Out of here.

859
01:23:24,994 --> 01:23:26,913
What for?
Because I don't like you.

860
01:23:59,992 --> 01:24:01,452
I'm sorry I screamed.

861
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,230
Benjamin, when you came up here,

862
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,587
what did you think was going
to happen between us?

863
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:15,071
Elaine - right now I don't
feel like talking much.

864
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:16,698
I'm sorry about everything.

865
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:18,388
but I think I'll just do this now.

866
01:24:30,276 --> 01:24:32,278
Can I just sit here while you're packing?

867
01:24:33,321 --> 01:24:34,281
If you want.

868
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:49,214
What are you going to do now?

869
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:51,800
I don't know.

870
01:24:53,302 --> 01:24:55,012
Are you going home?
No.

871
01:24:55,888 --> 01:24:57,014
Well, where are you going?

872
01:25:01,478 --> 01:25:03,480
Elaine, you're going to stop asking me.

873
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:18,414
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

874
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:22,919
I don't understand.

875
01:25:23,461 --> 01:25:25,004
I don't want you to go anywhere.

876
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,135
until you have a definite plan.

877
01:25:31,386 --> 01:25:32,388
Goodbye.

878
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:10,013
What's happening?

879
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:11,890
Benjamin?
What?

880
01:26:17,897 --> 01:26:19,190
Will you kiss me!

881
01:26:47,097 --> 01:26:48,682
Will you marry me?

882
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:54,939
You won't?
I don't know.

883
01:26:58,192 --> 01:27:01,821
But you might.
I might.

884
01:27:02,614 --> 01:27:07,077
Is that so? You might marry me?
Yes.

885
01:27:07,912 --> 01:27:08,996
When?

886
01:27:10,706 --> 01:27:11,833
I don't know.

887
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:15,232
How about tomorrow?
I don't mean to be pushy but -

888
01:27:15,337 --> 01:27:20,134
I don't know. I don't
know what's happening.

889
01:27:21,886 --> 01:27:23,596
You mean you're confused?

890
01:27:26,432 --> 01:27:28,518
Well, look, don't be confused.

891
01:27:29,352 --> 01:27:30,604
We're getting married.

892
01:27:32,231 --> 01:27:33,732
I don't see how we can.

893
01:27:37,612 --> 01:27:38,613
We just can.

894
01:27:46,288 --> 01:27:47,831
I have to go now.

895
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:54,422
Elaine, are you serious about this?

896
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:56,800
I'll think about it.

897
01:27:57,426 --> 01:27:59,720
You really will?
Yes.

898
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:18,929
We can go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

899
01:28:19,033 --> 01:28:20,827
Or this afternoon.
It's a good day for it.

900
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:23,309
Benjamin, I haven't even
said I'll marry you yet.

901
01:28:23,413 --> 01:28:25,019
We'll need our Birth Certificates.

902
01:28:25,123 --> 01:28:27,334
I happen to have mine
with me. Where's yours?

903
01:28:28,127 --> 01:28:30,630
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?

904
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,229
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would...

905
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:49,818
Tomorrow then - can we get our
blood tests tomorrow morning?

906
01:28:51,236 --> 01:28:54,406
Why don't you just drag me off
if you want to marry me so much?

907
01:28:54,531 --> 01:28:56,158
Why don't I just drag you off?

908
01:28:56,617 --> 01:28:59,746
All right, I will.
Right after we get the blood tests.

909
01:29:00,246 --> 01:29:02,040
I have to see Carl first.

910
01:29:02,248 --> 01:29:03,208
Carl who?

911
01:29:07,212 --> 01:29:08,422
Carl who?

912
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:12,447
Carl Smith. He's a medical student.
We've known him for years.

913
01:29:12,552 --> 01:29:14,450
Who, that guy at the Zoo?
Yes.

914
01:29:14,554 --> 01:29:15,847
Why do you have to see him?

915
01:29:16,014 --> 01:29:17,641
Well, I said I might marry him.

916
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:20,644
You WHAT?

917
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,938
How did he do it?

918
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,836
Did he get down on his knees?

919
01:29:24,941 --> 01:29:26,943
He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.

920
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:28,215
No, Benjamin.

921
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:30,614
Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

922
01:29:32,324 --> 01:29:35,619
He said he thought we'd
make a pretty good team.

923
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:37,496
Oh no. He said that.

924
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:39,832
Where did he do it?

925
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,753
I'd like to know where it happened?

926
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:49,093
It wasn't in his car, was it?

927
01:30:02,483 --> 01:30:03,526
Good Night.

928
01:30:04,443 --> 01:30:08,323
Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.

929
01:30:09,532 --> 01:30:11,243
The day after tomorrow?

930
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,248
I don't know. Maybe we are
and maybe we aren't.

931
01:31:06,972 --> 01:31:10,184
Do you want, do you want to
try and tell me why you did it?

932
01:31:12,144 --> 01:31:13,229
Mr. Robinson?

933
01:31:13,437 --> 01:31:15,419
Do you have a special grudge against me?

934
01:31:15,523 --> 01:31:18,339
Do you feel a particularly strong resentment?
No.

935
01:31:18,443 --> 01:31:21,759
Is there something I've said
that's caused this contempt?

936
01:31:21,864 --> 01:31:24,346
Or just the things I stand for that you despise?

937
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:25,910
It was nothing to do with you, sir.

938
01:31:26,244 --> 01:31:28,934
Well, Ben, it was quite
a bit to do with me.

939
01:31:29,038 --> 01:31:30,561
Now look, please!

940
01:31:30,665 --> 01:31:34,232
Ben, I think we're two civilized people.
Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?

941
01:31:34,336 --> 01:31:35,733
I'm not threatening you.

942
01:31:35,838 --> 01:31:38,841
Do you want to unclench your fists, please.
Thank you.

943
01:31:38,966 --> 01:31:41,386
I can see in the dark, you know.
I've been here quite a while.

944
01:31:41,511 --> 01:31:45,244
I am trying to tell you I have no personal
feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

945
01:31:45,348 --> 01:31:47,246
I am trying to tell you
I do not resent you.

946
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:49,645
You don't respect me terribly
much either, do you?

947
01:31:50,646 --> 01:31:51,543
No, Sir.

948
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:53,253
What?
No, Sir.

949
01:31:53,357 --> 01:31:57,842
Don't shout at me, Ben. I may not be younger
than you, but I still have good hearing.

950
01:31:57,946 --> 01:31:58,926
Mr. Robinson.

951
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:01,116
Have you the patience to wait untill I finish?

952
01:32:02,451 --> 01:32:05,016
I do think you know the consequences
of what you've done.

953
01:32:05,121 --> 01:32:08,583
I do think you should know that my
wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

954
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:11,836
But why?
Why?

955
01:32:12,045 --> 01:32:13,046
Listen to me.

956
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:18,844
What happened between Mrs. Robinson
and me was nothing. It mean anything.

957
01:32:18,969 --> 01:32:22,557
We might just as well have been shaking hands.

958
01:32:23,057 --> 01:32:26,958
Shaking hands. Well, that's not
saying much for my wife, is it?

959
01:32:27,062 --> 01:32:28,960
You miss the point.
I guess I do.

960
01:32:29,064 --> 01:32:31,942
The point is I don't love your wife.
I love your daughter, sir.

961
01:32:33,069 --> 01:32:34,570
All right, now listen this.

962
01:32:35,446 --> 01:32:38,220
I don't know what I can possibly do.
But I think I can.

963
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:41,870
I think I can get you behind bars if
you ever look at my daughter again.

964
01:32:42,454 --> 01:32:45,145
I have seen Elaine and I make
damned sure you can get to...

965
01:32:45,249 --> 01:32:46,792
Stay away from me, Ben!

966
01:32:48,461 --> 01:32:50,171
I don't want to mince words with you.

967
01:32:50,588 --> 01:32:54,343
As far as Elaine's concerned, you're to
get her out of your filthy mind right now.

968
01:32:54,718 --> 01:32:58,243
Is that perfectly clear to you?
And that's all, Ben.

969
01:32:58,347 --> 01:33:01,476
You'll pardon me if I don't
shake hands with you.

970
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,146
I think you are filth.

971
01:33:05,772 --> 01:33:07,524
I think you are scum.

972
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:11,153
You are a degenerate!

973
01:33:21,373 --> 01:33:23,876
Mr. McCleery, do you have some change?
I need to use the phone.

974
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,233
I want you out of here.

975
01:33:26,337 --> 01:33:29,924
Look, I'll give you ten dollars
for a dime. I'll give you twenty.

976
01:33:30,466 --> 01:33:32,761
For God's sake, will you
let me use that phone?

977
01:33:33,678 --> 01:33:35,931
I'll call the police, now.

978
01:33:36,056 --> 01:33:37,933
Could I make one phone call first?

979
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,852
Get out here!

980
01:33:51,073 --> 01:33:56,871
Elaine Robinson has left the school. Her
roommate is coming down with a note for you.

981
01:34:00,459 --> 01:34:02,586
Dear Benjamin, please forgive me.

982
01:34:02,878 --> 01:34:05,881
Because I know what I'm doing
is the best thing for you.

983
01:34:06,257 --> 01:34:08,760
My father is so upset
you've got to understand.

984
01:34:09,052 --> 01:34:11,054
I love you, but it would never work out.

985
01:35:35,941 --> 01:35:36,984
Elaine.

986
01:35:39,153 --> 01:35:40,613
Hello, Benjamin.

987
01:35:45,493 --> 01:35:46,390
Where is she?

988
01:35:46,494 --> 01:35:47,975
Hello. Get me the police, please.

989
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:48,976
Where is Elaine?

990
01:35:49,081 --> 01:35:50,207
I'll be with you in a moment.

991
01:35:50,374 --> 01:35:53,961
Do you have a petrol car in the
vicinity of 1200 Glenview Road.

992
01:35:54,754 --> 01:35:56,339
Good, we have a burgler here.

993
01:35:56,881 --> 01:35:59,384
Just a second. I'll ask him.
Are you armed?

994
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:04,097
No, I don't believe he is.
Thank you!

995
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:06,246
What have you done to her?

996
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:09,041
I think we have everything quite
under control now, Benjamin.

997
01:36:09,145 --> 01:36:10,876
Would you like a quick drink before you go?

998
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:13,692
You can't stop me from seeing her,
Mrs. Robinson.  I'll find her.

999
01:36:14,276 --> 01:36:16,799
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite
you to the wedding, Benjamin

1000
01:36:16,904 --> 01:36:18,822
but the arrangements have been so rushed.

1001
01:36:20,491 --> 01:36:21,951
What the hell have you done?

1002
01:36:27,082 --> 01:36:30,210
Ahh.  I don't think you'll have
time for that drink after all.

1003
01:36:31,962 --> 01:36:34,215
I'll find her.
I don't think so.

1004
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:43,709
Say, fellows. Any of you fellows
know where Carl Smith is?

1005
01:37:43,876 --> 01:37:46,525
He took off in the middle of
the night to get married.

1006
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:48,882
Proabaly one step ahead of the shotgun.

1007
01:37:49,883 --> 01:37:53,304
Would you happen to know where he's
getting married? I'm supposed to be there.

1008
01:37:53,804 --> 01:37:55,014
Why not just ask Carter?

1009
01:37:55,806 --> 01:37:57,892
Would you happen to know
where I might find him?

1010
01:37:58,476 --> 01:38:02,898
Hey, Carter, where's the Make
Out King getting married?

1011
01:38:03,023 --> 01:38:04,358
Santa Barbara.

1012
01:38:05,025 --> 01:38:08,675
You don't happen to know exactly where
the Make Out King is getting married, do you?

1013
01:38:08,779 --> 01:38:10,114
I'm supposed to be there.

1014
01:38:10,364 --> 01:38:11,991
Where side of Santa Barbara?

1015
01:38:13,409 --> 01:38:15,829
I don't know. Maybe at his old man's house.

1016
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:17,915
He only told me these words.

1017
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:21,001
Are you going to the wedding?
Yes.

1018
01:38:21,293 --> 01:38:23,504
Hey, tell him to save the piece for me.

1019
01:38:25,423 --> 01:38:26,508
of the wedding cake.

1020
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,770
Can I use your phone?
Yes.

1021
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:43,865
657-2036
Hello - who is this?

1022
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:45,784
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

1023
01:39:45,888 --> 01:39:47,098
Is the doctor anywhere?

1024
01:39:47,307 --> 01:39:49,955
I'm afraid Doctor can't be reached right now.
If you like to...

1025
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:51,311
I'd like to know where he is.

1026
01:39:51,895 --> 01:39:55,253
Well, you see, the doctor is at his son's
wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now.

1027
01:39:55,357 --> 01:39:56,796
He should be checking in any moment.

1028
01:39:56,901 --> 01:40:00,801
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's
brother - Reverend Smith -

1029
01:40:00,905 --> 01:40:03,888
and I am supposed to perform the
ceremony. I just got in from Portland.

1030
01:40:03,992 --> 01:40:05,702
and I've forgotten what church, you see?

1031
01:40:05,994 --> 01:40:10,020
Oh. Well, I'm not sure, but you
might try the First Presbyterian.

1032
01:40:10,124 --> 01:40:11,918
That's on Allan Street.
Thank you!

1033
01:40:13,211 --> 01:40:14,504
Allan Street. Where is it?

1034
01:40:15,714 --> 01:40:23,180
Alan Street. It's, it's
6 blocks up, and 3 over.

1035
01:40:24,515 --> 01:40:26,309
You need any gas, Father?

1036
01:42:14,305 --> 01:42:17,058
Oh, Jesus - God - no -

1037
01:42:27,987 --> 01:42:38,541
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1038
01:42:38,791 --> 01:42:40,918
Who is that guy?
What's he doing?

1039
01:42:41,461 --> 01:42:43,713
I'll take care of him.
He is too late.

1040
01:42:45,465 --> 01:42:52,932
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1041
01:42:53,933 --> 01:42:55,935
Get to stop him.

1042
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,333
Ben!

1043
01:43:21,547 --> 01:43:24,009
You are crazy buck!

1044
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:42,946
Elaine, it's too late.
Not for me! Not for me!

1
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,448
Sir.

2
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,783
General.

3
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,795
Sir.

4
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,478
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,359
-Still nothing?
-Not a sign.

6
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,321
-How long has he been gone?
-Nearly two hours.

7
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,075
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,660
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,288
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,665
-They're out of range.
-Range is good.

11
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,795
-The danger to the cavalry...
-Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,556
They say no.

13
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,043
People should know
when they're conquered.

14
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,305
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,516
Would I?

16
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,952
-Strength and honor.
-Strength and honor.

17
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,752
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,985
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,821
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,700
-Archers ready.
-Archers!

21
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,285
-Nock!
-Nock!

22
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,435
Fratres!

23
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,353
-Maximus!
-Maximus!

24
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,901
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,447
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

26
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,493
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,245
If you find yourself alone,

28
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,332
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

29
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,710
do not be troubled.

30
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,173
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,010
Brothers,

32
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,222
what we do in life

33
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,933
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,734
Pull!

35
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,377
Cohorts ready, sir!

36
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,390
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,268
-Ignite!
-Ignite!

38
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,818
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,656
Loose!

40
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,770
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,570
Hold the line!

42
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,955
Loose!

43
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,498
Reload!

44
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,547
Hold the line!

45
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,966
-Draw!
-Loose!

46
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,304
Stay with me!

47
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,895
Stay with me!

48
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,759
Roma victor!

49
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,705
Roma victor!

50
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,041
Do you think he's really dying?

51
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,461
He's been dying for 10 years.

52
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,966
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

53
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,843
Maybe he just misses us.

54
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,512
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

55
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,889
Peace, Commodus.

56
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,265
After two weeks on the road,

57
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,018
your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.

58
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,862
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

59
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,409
He will name me.

60
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,916
The first thing I shall do when...

61
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,005
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

62
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,927
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

63
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,430
Your Highness?

64
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,228
We seem to be almost there, sir.

65
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,611
-Sire.
-Where's the Emperor?

66
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,365
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

67
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,659
The wounded are still coming in.

68
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,369
My horse.

69
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,120
My lord.

70
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,750
Kiss?

71
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,206
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

72
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,086
Let us hope, for the last time.

73
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,755
There's no one left to fight, sire.

74
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,508
There is always someone left to fight.

75
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,511
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

76
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,518
Let me go home.

77
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,314
Home.

78
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,667
They honor you, Caesar.

79
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,545
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

80
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,237
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

81
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,699
You have missed the war.

82
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,993
Father, congratulations.

83
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,871
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

84
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,623
Save the bulls.

85
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,167
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

86
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,920
-General.
-Highness.

87
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,508
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

88
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,385
It has been too long, my old friend.

89
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,928
Highness.

90
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,597
Here, Father. Take my arm.

91
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,394
I think it is time for me to leave.

92
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,870
So much for the glory of Rome.

93
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,711
Magnificent battle.

94
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,362
General. Still alive?

95
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,738
Still alive.

96
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,448
The gods must have a sense of humor.

97
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,201
-The gods must love you.
-Valerius.

98
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,162
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

99
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,332
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

100
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,294
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

101
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,006
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

102
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,175
-Here he is.
-Highness.

103
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,427
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

104
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,389
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear,

105
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,059
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll
say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

106
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,812
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

107
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,773
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

108
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,067
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

109
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,153
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

110
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,488
A soldier has the advantage

111
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,992
of being able to
look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

112
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:06,079
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

113
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,291
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

114
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,552
Maximus.

115
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,139
I'm going to need good men like you.

116
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,810
How may I be of service, Highness?

117
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,938
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

118
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,358
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.

119
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:40,238
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

120
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,783
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

121
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,995
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

122
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,754
Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.

123
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,007
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

124
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,346
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

125
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,017
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

126
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,436
She's not forgotten you.

127
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,065
And now, you're the great man.

128
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,871
If only you had been born a man,

129
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,208
what a Caesar you would have made.

130
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,336
Father.

131
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,344
You would have been strong.

132
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,681
I wonder, would you have been just?

133
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,101
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

134
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,646
How was your journey?

135
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,483
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

136
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,653
I need your help. With your brother.

137
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,780
Of course.

138
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,990
He loves you. He always has.

139
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,243
And

140
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,289
he will need you now, more than ever.

141
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,255
Enough of politics.

142
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,466
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter,

143
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,428
and I am a good father.

144
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,728
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

145
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,200
Good morning to you.

146
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,883
I need three more horses.

147
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,936
One! Two! Three!

148
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,938
Four!

149
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,274
One! Two!

150
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,417
You sent for me, Caesar?

151
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,050
-Caesar?
-Tell me again, Maximus.

152
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,844
Why are we here?

153
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,681
For the glory of the empire, sire.

154
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,183
Yes.

155
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,187
Yes, I remember.

156
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,526
Do you see that map, Maximus?

157
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,862
That is the world which I created.

158
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,365
For 25 years,

159
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,786
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

160
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,958
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

161
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,544
Four years of peace in 20.

162
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,337
And for what?

163
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,557
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

164
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,142
Caesar, your life...

165
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,812
Please. Please don't call me that.

166
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,356
Come. Please.

167
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,525
Come sit.

168
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,070
Let us talk together now,

169
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,073
very simply, as men.

170
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,576
Well, Maximus,

171
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,121
talk.

172
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,085
Five thousand of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

173
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,962
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

174
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,505
Two thousand will
never leave this place.

175
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,800
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

176
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,510
And what would you believe?

177
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:16,431
They fought for you and for Rome.

178
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,308
And what is Rome, Maximus?

179
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,896
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

180
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,983
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

181
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,985
Yet you have never been there.

182
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,529
You have not seen what it has become.

183
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,657
I am dying, Maximus.

184
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,576
When a man sees his end,

185
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,704
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

186
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:44,000
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

187
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,377
Will I be known as the philosopher?

188
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,962
The warrior?

189
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,672
The tyrant?

190
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:55,803
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

191
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,223
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

192
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,060
You could only whisper it.

193
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,229
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,

194
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,148
it was so fragile.

195
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,152
And I fear that it will not survive
the winter.

196
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,155
Maximus,

197
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,992
let us whisper now,

198
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,953
together, you and I.

199
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,163
You have a son.

200
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,541
Tell me about your home.

201
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,676
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

202
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,804
A very simple place.

203
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,140
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

204
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,727
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day,

205
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,397
jasmine in the evening.

206
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,651
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

207
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,779
Figs, apples, pears.

208
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,700
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

209
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,911
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

210
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,247
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

211
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,957
He wants to be one of them.

212
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,834
When was the last time
you were home?

213
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:11,045
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

214
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,967
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

215
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,387
Worth fighting for.

216
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,350
There is one more duty

217
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,645
that I ask of you before you go home.

218
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,691
What would you have me do, Caesar?

219
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,403
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

220
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,574
I will empower you to one end alone,

221
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,578
to give power back
to the people of Rome,

222
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,998
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

223
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,924
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

224
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,219
With all my heart, no.

225
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,515
Maximus,

226
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,019
that is why it must be you.

227
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,188
But surely a prefect, a senator,

228
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,982
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

229
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,027
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

230
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:24,660
-And Commodus?
-Commodus is not a moral man.

231
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,247
You have known that
since you were young.

232
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,291
Commodus cannot rule.

233
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,752
He must not rule.

234
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,090
You are the son that I should have had.

235
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,637
Commodus will accept my decision.

236
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:49,685
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

237
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,150
I need some time, sire.

238
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,693
Yes.

239
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,322
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

240
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,575
Now embrace me as my son.

241
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,706
And bring an old man another blanket.

242
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,433
-My father favors you now.
-My lady.

243
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,020
-It was not always so.
-Many things change.

244
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,524
Many things. Not everything.

245
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,070
Maximus, stop.

246
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,534
Let me see your face.

247
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,789
-You seem upset.
-I lost many men.

248
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,042
What did my father want with you?

249
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,088
To wish me well before I leave for home.

250
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,215
You're lying.

251
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,886
I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.

252
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,470
I never acquired your comfort with it.

253
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,597
True.

254
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,765
But then you never had to.

255
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,977
Life is more simple for a soldier.

256
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,981
Or do you think me heartless?

257
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,735
I think you have a talent for survival.

258
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,284
Maximus, stop.

259
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,372
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

260
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,958
No. I'm tired from battle.

261
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,378
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

262
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,928
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

263
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,474
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

264
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,811
I will always serve Rome.

265
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,523
Do you know,

266
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,109
I still remember you in my prayers.

267
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,072
Oh, yes. I pray.

268
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,955
I was sad to hear of your husband's
death. I mourned him.

269
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,668
-Thank you.
-And I hear you have a son.

270
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,755
Yes. Lucius.

271
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,342
He'll be nearly eight years old.

272
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,678
My son is also nearly eight.

273
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,641
I thank you for your prayers.

274
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,943
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

275
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,823
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

276
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,245
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

277
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,332
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

278
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,669
Ancestors, I honor you,

279
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,132
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

280
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,239
Cicero.

281
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:35,953
Sir.

282
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,960
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

283
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,257
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

284
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,552
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

285
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,433
We may not be able to go home,
after all.

286
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,362
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

287
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,950
Yes, Father.

288
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,120
You will not be emperor.

289
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,792
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

290
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,419
My powers will pass to Maximus,

291
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,381
to hold in trust,

292
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,176
until the Senate is ready to rule
once more.

293
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,181
Rome is to be a republic again.

294
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,727
-Maximus.
-Yes.

295
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,069
My decision disappoints you?

296
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,658
You wrote to me once,

297
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,954
listing the four chief virtues.

298
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,082
Wisdom,

299
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,625
justice,

300
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,169
fortitude,

301
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,379
and temperance.

302
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,676
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

303
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,096
But I have other virtues, Father.

304
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,640
Ambition.

305
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,853
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

306
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,274
Resourcefulness, courage.

307
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,654
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

308
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,534
Devotion to my family,

309
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,037
to you.

310
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,333
But none of my virtues were on your list.

311
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,922
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

312
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,381
Commodus,

313
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,926
you go too far.

314
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,721
I searched the faces of the gods

315
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:45,851
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

316
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,729
One kind word,

317
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,065
one full hug,

318
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,902
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight,

319
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,573
would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.

320
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,828
What is it in me you hate so much?

321
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,121
Commodus.

322
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,291
All I've ever wanted

323
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,837
was to live up to you, Caesar.

324
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,758
-Father.
-Commodus,

325
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,265
your faults as a son

326
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,602
is my failure as a father.

327
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,781
Come.

328
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,786
Father.

329
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,429
I would butcher the whole world,

330
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,807
if you would only have loved me!

331
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,556
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

332
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,855
Lament with me, brother.

333
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,900
Our great father is dead.

334
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,220
How did he die?

335
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,182
The surgeons say there was no pain.

336
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,393
His breath gave out as he slept.

337
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,404
Father.

338
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,742
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

339
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,703
Take my hand.

340
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,250
I only offer it once.

341
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:11,765
Quintus.

342
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,484
Hail, Caesar.

343
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,070
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

344
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,740
-Wake Gaius and Falco.
-Gaius and Falco.

345
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,034
-Sword.
-Sword.

346
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,456
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

347
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,334
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

348
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,295
The emperor died of natural causes.

349
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,299
-Why are you armed, Quintus?
-Guards!

350
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,679
Please don't fight, Maximus.

351
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,725
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

352
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,977
Ride until dawn,

353
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,772
and then execute him.

354
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,274
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

355
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,444
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

356
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,198
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

357
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,307
Kneel.

358
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,230
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

359
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,400
Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.

360
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,405
At least give me a clean death.

361
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,908
A soldier's death.

362
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,391
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

363
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,455
Praetorian!

364
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,120
When was the last time
you were home?

365
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,206
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

366
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,626
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

367
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,087
I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

368
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,631
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

369
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,134
...with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.

370
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,387
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

371
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,764
For all else is dust and air.

372
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,035
Papa!

373
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,617
Don't die.

374
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,583
You'll meet them again.

375
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,920
Not yet.

376
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,224
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

377
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,010
Don't die.

378
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,221
They'll feed you to the lions.

379
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,598
They are worth more than we are.

380
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,068
Better now?

381
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,071
Clean. You see?

382
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,646
Proximo! My old friend.

383
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,109
Every day is a great day
when you are here,

384
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,739
but today is your most fortunate day.

385
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:59,079
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

386
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,625
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

387
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,837
You sold me queer giraffes.

388
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,424
-I want my money back.
-Not a chance.

389
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,847
-I do special price for you.
-On what?

390
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,852
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

391
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,577
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

392
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:42,455
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

393
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,874
You need both, I think.

394
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,167
Get up.

395
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,802
What's your trade?

396
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,762
I was a hunter.

397
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:01,558
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

398
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,726
Sit down.

399
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:08,940
Mark of the legion.

400
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,861
-Deserter.
-Maybe so, but who cares?

401
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,445
He's a Spaniard.

402
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,489
I'll take six. For 1,000.

403
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:20,076
1,000?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

404
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,245
These slaves are rotten.

405
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,498
It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

406
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,709
I can negotiate.

407
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:33,006
I'll give you 2,000,
and 4,000 for the beasts.

408
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,216
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

409
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,279
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

410
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,281
I am Proximo.

411
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:01,534
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

412
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,828
which will be the last
of your miserable lives,

413
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:08,249
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

414
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,878
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

415
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,299
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

416
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:20,803
And as your mother was there
at your beginning,

417
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,390
so I shall be there at your end.

418
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,937
And when you die, and die you shall,

419
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,774
your transition shall be to the sound of...

420
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,947
Gladiators,

421
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,616
I salute you.

422
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,413
Red.

423
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,418
Yellow.

424
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,837
Yellow.

425
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,683
Good.

426
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,851
-Red.
-Red.

427
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,066
Spaniard.

428
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,768
That's enough for the moment!

429
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,729
His time will come.

430
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,816
Next.

431
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,497
Spaniard,

432
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,792
why don't you fight?

433
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,627
We all have to fight.

434
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,421
Well, I don't fight.

435
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,300
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words,

436
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,260
and speak seven languages.

437
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:25,386
Good.

438
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:29,349
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

439
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,985
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

440
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,279
Freedom?

441
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,199
What do I have to do?

442
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,910
You go in the arena and you kill me.

443
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,370
And him,

444
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:53,081
and the Numidian,

445
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,749
and the deserter.

446
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,794
And 100 more.

447
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,713
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

448
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,132
I can't do that.

449
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,385
No?

450
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,059
But I can.

451
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,785
Is that the sign of your gods?

452
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,084
Will that not anger them?

453
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,065
The gods favor you.

454
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,609
Red is the gods' color.

455
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,155
You will need their help today.

456
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,154
Proximo!

457
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,661
Still leading with the German?

458
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,830
The crowd love a barbarian.

459
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,208
Besides that, he's making me rich.

460
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,919
Has that Numidian fought before?

461
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,338
No, first time.

462
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,382
And that one, laborer, soldier?

463
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,051
He's a Spaniard.

464
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,221
He might as well be a eunuch
for what he brings to the ring.

465
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:18,392
500 sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

466
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:22,188
And 1,000, that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

467
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,817
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

468
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,154
It's unethical.

469
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:32,114
What if I make it 2,000?

470
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,465
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

471
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,051
some that you can't fight.

472
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,889
They all say that until they're out there.

473
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,851
Listen.

474
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,854
-Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill!

475
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,698
Thrust this into another man's flesh,

476
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:16,784
and they will applaud and love you
for that.

477
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,286
And you,

478
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,206
you may begin to love them

479
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,458
for that.

480
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:32,049
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

481
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,887
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

482
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,933
but we can decide
how we meet that end,

483
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,353
in order that we are remembered

484
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,523
as men.

485
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,649
Come on!

486
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,904
On the left, draw your shields!

487
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,325
On the right, draw your swords!

488
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,161
-Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill!

489
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,706
Pair them up, red with yellow.

490
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:09,962
Next!

491
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:16,927
Move!

492
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,334
Usurper!

493
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,693
-Go away!
-You'll never rule us, Commodus!

494
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:35,811
He enters Rome like a conquering
hero. But what has he conquered?

495
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,522
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

496
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:40,899
I think he could do very well.

497
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,193
For Rome, or for you?

498
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,578
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

499
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,086
-Lucius!
-Mother!

500
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,923
Hail, Caesar.

501
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,508
Senators.

502
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,057
Rome greets her new emperor.

503
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,685
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

504
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,604
Thank you, Falco.

505
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,775
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

506
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,860
-Caesar.
-Gracchus.

507
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,446
All Rome rejoices in your return,
Caesar.

508
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,033
But there are many matters
that require your attention.

509
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,372
To order, please. To order.

510
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,624
For your guidance, Caesar,

511
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,502
the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols

512
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:44,672
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city,

513
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:48,842
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,

514
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,971
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

515
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,848
So, if Caesar...

516
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,894
Don't you see, Gracchus?

517
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,606
That's the very problem, isn't it?

518
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,693
My father spent all his time at study,

519
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,823
at books of learning and philosophy.

520
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,327
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

521
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,498
And all the while,
the people were forgotten.

522
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,292
But the senate is the people, sire,

523
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:25,921
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

524
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:30,217
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

525
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,429
Or have such splendid mistresses,
Gaius.

526
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,597
I think I understand my own people.

527
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,184
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us,

528
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,229
out of his own extensive experience.

529
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,651
I call it love.

530
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,363
I am their father.
The people are my children.

531
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,158
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

532
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,703
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

533
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,628
No, but if you interrupt me again,

534
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,465
I assure you that you shall.

535
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,884
Senator, my brother is very tired.

536
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:17,055
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

537
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,561
My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

538
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,945
Who are they to lecture me?

539
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,782
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

540
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,743
What uses? All they do is talk.

541
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,499
It should be just you and me and Rome.

542
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,919
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

543
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,087
Rome has changed.

544
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,216
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

545
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,593
Of course, but leave the people their...

546
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,053
Illusions?

547
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,097
Traditions.

548
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,768
My father's war against the barbarians.

549
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:07,022
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

550
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,982
The people always love victories.

551
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:12,736
Why? They didn't see the battles.

552
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,031
What do they care about Germania?

553
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,450
They care about the greatness of Rome.

554
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,452
"The greatness of Rome."

555
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,206
Well, what is that?

556
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:30,128
It's an idea. Greatness.

557
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,302
-Greatness is a vision.
-Exactly. A vision.

558
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,348
Do you not see, Lucilla?

559
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,687
I will give the people a vision
of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

560
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,733
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

561
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,456
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

562
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,594
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

563
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,062
Games.

564
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:15,400
One hundred and fifty days of games.

565
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,444
He's cleverer than I thought.

566
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:21,073
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

567
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,159
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

568
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,037
Fear and wonder.
A powerful combination.

569
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:31,583
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

570
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,753
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

571
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,590
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

572
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,427
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

573
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:47,349
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

574
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,434
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

575
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,480
He'll bring them death,

576
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,609
and they will love him for it.

577
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,384
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

578
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,886
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

579
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,014
We want them to keep coming back.

580
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:31,268
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

581
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,230
Spaniard.

582
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,573
So entertain!

583
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,809
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?

584
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,355
Is this not why you're here?

585
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,987
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

586
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,450
-Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
-Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

587
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,006
What do you want?

588
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,718
Girl?

589
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,929
Boy?

590
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,099
-You sent for me.
-Yes, I did.

591
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,270
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

592
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,521
You could be magnificent.

593
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,108
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.

594
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,028
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

595
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:54,327
The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles

596
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:58,582
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

597
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,084
I find that amusing,

598
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:04,504
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

599
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:08,049
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

600
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:15,181
So finally, after five years
of scratching a living

601
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,475
in flea-infested villages,

602
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,604
we're finally going back
to where we belong.

603
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,898
The Colosseum.

604
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,944
You should see the Colosseum,
Spaniard.

605
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,323
Fifty thousand Romans,

606
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:36,119
watching every movement
of your sword,

607
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:40,040
willing you to make that killer blow.

608
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,836
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

609
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:49,466
It rises. It rises up,

610
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,302
like a storm.

611
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,764
As if you were the thunder god himself.

612
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,808
-You were a gladiator?
-Yes, I was.

613
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,442
You won your freedom?

614
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,861
A long time ago, the Emperor

615
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,615
presented me with a rudius.

616
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,409
It's just a wooden sword.

617
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,372
The symbol of your freedom.

618
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,543
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

619
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,339
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

620
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:33,677
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

621
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,388
You asked me what I want.

622
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,684
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor,

623
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,353
as you did.

624
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,856
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

625
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,777
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

626
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,656
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

627
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,077
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

628
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,417
I will win the crowd.

629
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:11,089
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

630
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,093
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

631
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,595
and have bloody adventures.

632
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,472
And the great whore will suckle us

633
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,142
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

634
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,685
And then,

635
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,938
when enough men have died,

636
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,568
perhaps you will have your freedom.

637
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,324
Here. Use this.

638
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:05,226
It's somewhere out there, my country.

639
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:07,645
My home.

640
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,982
My wife is preparing food.

641
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,652
My daughters carry water from the river.

642
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,031
Will I ever see them again?

643
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,825
I think, no.

644
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,578
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

645
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,038
I think so.

646
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:28,750
But then, I will die soon.

647
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,837
They will not die for many years.

648
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,298
I'll have to wait.

649
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,550
But you would? Wait?

650
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,552
Of course.

651
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,847
You see,

652
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,560
my wife and my son

653
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,439
are already waiting for me.

654
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:55,193
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

655
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,615
Not yet.

656
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,910
-Unless...
-Not yet.

657
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,207
Not yet.

658
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,638
There he is.

659
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,897
Out.

660
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,025
Move, go, out!

661
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,248
Good to see you again, old friend.

662
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,297
Bring me fortune.

663
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,763
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

664
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:50,433
I didn't know men
could build such things.

665
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,986
Win the crowd.

666
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,530
Get inside. Move.

667
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,907
Inside.

668
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,875
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

669
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,880
Come, brother. It's late.

670
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,304
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

671
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,435
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

672
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:19,063
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

673
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,865
Commodus, drink this tonic.

674
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,877
I think the time is almost right.

675
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:44,172
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

676
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,341
at the celebration to honor our father.

677
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,384
Do you think I should?

678
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,054
Are the people ready?

679
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,558
I think you need your rest now.

680
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:03,316
Will you stay with me?

681
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,818
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

682
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,785
Still.

683
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:16,913
Always.

684
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,501
-Stay with me tonight.
-You know I won't.

685
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,507
Then kiss me.

686
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,850
Sleep, brother.

687
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,780
Having servants who are deaf and mute

688
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,616
at least ensures I live a little longer.

689
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,745
They're arresting scholars now.

690
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,666
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

691
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,210
And mathematicians.

692
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,547
And all to feed the arena.

693
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,634
The Senate did not approve martial law.

694
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,554
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

695
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,849
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

696
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,478
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

697
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:08,274
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

698
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:14,030
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

699
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,742
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,

700
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,661
planning the festival
to honor your father.

701
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:24,332
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

702
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,293
So just what is he planning?

703
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,295
And what pays for it?

704
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,591
These daily games are costing
a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

705
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:35,760
The future.

706
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,180
The future pays for it.

707
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:43,518
He's started selling the grain reserves.

708
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,436
This can't be true.

709
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,564
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

710
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:52,068
The people will be starving in two years.

711
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,111
I hope they're enjoying the games,

712
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:57,573
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

713
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,243
-Rome must know this.
-And how?

714
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,120
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

715
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:07,291
And who will tell them
before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

716
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,127
You, Gaius.

717
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:11,921
Will you make a speech
on the floor of the Senate,

718
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,756
denouncing my brother?

719
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,842
And then see your family
in the Colosseum?

720
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,178
Who'd dare?

721
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:31,399
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day,

722
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,068
because my son is heir to the throne.

723
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,158
He must die.

724
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:49,292
Quintus and the Praetorians would
simply seize control for themselves.

725
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:53,254
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

726
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,381
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

727
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,594
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

728
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:02,638
So we do nothing?

729
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:05,516
No, child. We keep our counsel.

730
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,852
We prepare.

731
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:13,482
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

732
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,693
We are air.

733
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,490
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

734
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,452
One day, he'll have more enemies
than friends.

735
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,830
And on that day, we will act.

736
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:30,291
Then we will strike.

737
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,960
But until then,

738
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,713
we are docile.

739
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,341
We are obedient.

740
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,927
And we are treacherous.

741
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:51,729
Come on!

742
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,615
All right, that's enough.

743
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,514
The Emperor wants battles,

744
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,766
and I don't want to sacrifice
my best fighters.

745
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,186
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

746
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,856
-You get the battle of Carthage.
-Massacre of Carthage.

747
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,235
Well, why don't you go down
to the prison,

748
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,320
round up all the beggars and thieves?

749
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:42,571
We've done that.

750
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:45,032
If you want to give away
the best gladiators

751
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:46,283
in the whole of the empire,

752
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,494
then I want double the rates.

753
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:52,373
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract canceled.

754
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,874
You don't like it?

755
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:57,920
Then you can crawl back down
that shit hole that you came from.

756
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,175
Cassius, please. You can free us.

757
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,125
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

758
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,334
Yes.

759
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:40,337
They said you were a giant.

760
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,591
They said you could crush
a man's skull with one hand.

761
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,426
A man's? No.

762
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,095
A boy's.

763
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,642
-Do they have good horses in Spain?
-Some of the best.

764
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,772
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

765
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,983
They were my horses.

766
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,986
They were taken from me.

767
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,573
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.

768
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,452
-They let you watch the games?
-My uncle says it makes me strong.

769
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,830
-And what does your father say?
-My father is dead.

770
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,667
Master Lucius, it is time.

771
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,295
I have to go.

772
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,963
Your name is Lucius?

773
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,760
Lucius Verus, after my father.

774
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,125
Lower!

775
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:08,175
-Claudius!
-Yes?

776
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,678
-More shields!
-All right.

777
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:34,535
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him,

778
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,662
and then speak together.

779
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,958
Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.

780
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,920
Go, and die with honor.

781
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:42,061
Hail, mighty Caesar!

782
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:49,526
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

783
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,532
-We who are about to die salute you!
-We who are about to die salute you!

784
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,827
On this day

785
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,539
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

786
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:07,086
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

787
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,213
of mighty Carthage!

788
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:17,346
On the barren plain of Zama

789
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:21,058
there stood the invincible armies

790
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,061
of the barbarian Hannibal.

791
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:27,940
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

792
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,401
from all brute nations,

793
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:34,780
bent on merciless destruction,

794
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,032
conquest.

795
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:41,996
Your emperor is pleased to give you

796
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,124
the barbarian horde!

797
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,467
Anyone here been in the army?

798
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:58,470
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

799
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:01,098
You can help me.

800
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:04,935
Whatever comes out of these gates,

801
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:09,481
we've got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

802
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,275
Do you understand?

803
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:15,446
If we stay together, we survive.

804
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,657
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

805
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:22,327
of Scipio Africanus!

806
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,840
To the death!

807
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,221
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

808
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,643
Stay close.

809
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,526
Come together!

810
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:59,907
Stay close. Staggered columns!

811
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,172
You don't have a chance.

812
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:29,061
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

813
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:32,147
Hold!

814
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:37,194
Hold! As one!

815
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:41,448
Well done.

816
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:57,172
Hold. Down low!

817
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,179
Yes!

818
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:17,526
Hagen!

819
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:45,179
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

820
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,184
Quickly!

821
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,604
-Get out there.
-Hurry!

822
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:35,979
Maximus!

823
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,619
Single column! Single column!

824
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,332
We win!

825
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,215
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

826
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,969
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

827
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:50,804
Yes, sire.

828
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:54,099
Forgive me, sire.

829
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,893
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

830
01:36:57,687 --> 01:36:58,812
Who is he?

831
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:01,898
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

832
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,320
I think I'll meet him.

833
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:07,738
Yes, sire.

834
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,867
Hail to the barbarians!

835
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:30,218
Forward! Arms at ready!

836
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,442
Drop your weapons.

837
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:52,407
Gladiator, the Emperor
has asked for you.

838
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,243
I am at the Emperor's service.

839
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:24,064
Rise. Rise.

840
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,659
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

841
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,245
I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.

842
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:41,248
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

843
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:42,916
Or was it Hercules?

844
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:48,171
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

845
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:51,842
You do have a name.

846
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:54,511
My name is Gladiator.

847
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,976
How dare you show your back
to me? Slave!

848
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:05,689
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

849
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,953
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

850
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,289
commander of the armies of the north,

851
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:24,708
general of the Felix Legions,

852
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,086
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

853
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,673
father to a murdered son,

854
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,426
husband to a murdered wife,

855
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,513
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

856
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,897
Arms!

857
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:03,330
Live! Live! Live! Live!

858
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:06,625
-Live! Live! Live! Live!
-Live! Live! Live! Live!

859
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:53,338
Arms, at rest!

860
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:50,312
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

861
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,569
Father.

862
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,812
Why is he still alive?

863
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,565
I don't know.

864
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,650
He shouldn't be alive.

865
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:02,902
It vexes me.

866
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:06,448
I'm terribly vexed.

867
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:19,586
I did what I had to do.

868
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:24,382
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

869
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:26,134
You do see that.

870
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:27,677
Yes.

871
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:35,685
What did you feel when you saw him?

872
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,439
I felt nothing.

873
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,943
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

874
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:47,197
No more than I wounded him.

875
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,995
They lied to me in Germania.

876
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,707
They told me he was dead.

877
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:02,295
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

878
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:05,715
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

879
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:09,427
Then you must let the legions know

880
01:45:09,512 --> 01:45:12,597
their treachery will not go unpunished.

881
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:14,891
Poor sister.

882
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,769
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

883
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,730
What will you do?

884
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,036
This way.

885
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:13,866
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

886
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:16,452
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

887
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:19,581
I didn't realize he would send his best.

888
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:23,293
Maximus, he doesn't know.

889
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:27,380
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

890
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:30,008
-I knew nothing...
-Don't lie to me!

891
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:38,224
I wept for them.

892
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:42,145
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?

893
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,815
I have been living
in a prison of fear since that day.

894
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:50,153
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

895
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:54,240
To live in terror
every moment of every day,

896
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:57,118
because your son is heir to the throne.

897
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:00,455
I have wept.

898
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:04,626
My son was innocent.

899
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:07,503
So is mine.

900
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:12,592
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

901
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:17,013
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

902
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:20,933
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

903
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:24,479
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.

904
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:26,356
The gods have spared me?

905
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:29,901
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

906
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,527
That is power.

907
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,154
The mob is Rome.

908
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,866
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

909
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,743
Listen to me.

910
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:42,413
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

911
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:44,749
But while the people follow him,

912
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,877
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

913
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:51,130
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

914
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:54,967
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

915
01:47:55,052 --> 01:47:56,803
One man above all.

916
01:47:57,888 --> 01:48:00,973
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

917
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,226
Do you not understand?

918
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:07,689
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

919
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,441
What possible difference can I make?

920
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,985
This man wants what you want.

921
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,279
Then have him kill Commodus!

922
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,701
I knew a man once,

923
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:21,911
a noble man.

924
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,790
A man of principle who loved my father,

925
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,835
and my father loved him.

926
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:32,964
This man served Rome well.

927
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,011
That man is gone.

928
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,306
Your brother did his work well.

929
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:44,058
Let me help you.

930
01:48:49,982 --> 01:48:53,067
Yes, you can help me.

931
01:48:56,405 --> 01:49:00,116
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

932
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,539
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

933
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,652
What's your name?

934
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:41,240
Julian Crassus.

935
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:47,997
Name?

936
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,792
Marcus, sire.

937
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,419
My father's name.

938
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:03,095
They must have known
of Maximus' escape,

939
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:06,015
when they found
the bodies of the four men.

940
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:09,060
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

941
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:13,272
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

942
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:22,323
Load your arrows!

943
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,874
Prepare to fire!

944
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:55,690
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

945
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,234
and never told me.

946
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:00,736
-I didn't know.
-You didn't know?

947
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:05,074
But a general is always in control.

948
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:10,121
Always in command, isn't he?

949
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,124
Yes, Caesar.

950
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:29,765
Then give the command. Say it.

951
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:47,783
Fire.

952
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:24,362
Maximus.

953
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:28,240
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

954
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,327
-Yes.
-In Germania?

955
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:34,997
In many countries.

956
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:37,917
General.

957
01:53:27,008 --> 01:53:28,884
You have a great name.

958
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:33,431
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

959
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:43,733
Yes, at the far end.

960
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,735
-Senator Gaius.
-Hello.

961
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,195
Senator Gracchus.

962
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:53,200
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

963
01:53:53,285 --> 01:53:56,412
I don't pretend to be
a man of the people, Senator,

964
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:59,039
but I do try to be a man for the people.

965
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:20,519
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

966
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,650
People of Rome!

967
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:31,405
On the fourth day of Antioch,

968
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:36,410
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

969
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:41,290
And in his majestic charity,

970
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:46,253
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

971
01:54:46,838 --> 01:54:50,257
with an historical final match.

972
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:55,638
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,

973
01:54:57,057 --> 01:55:00,518
Caesar is pleased to bring you

974
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:04,396
the only undefeated champion

975
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:06,440
in Roman history,

976
01:55:06,525 --> 01:55:11,445
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

977
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,178
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

978
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:38,973
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

979
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:41,851
This is not it. This is not it!

980
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:44,770
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

981
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:48,190
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

982
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,985
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

983
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:54,947
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo,

984
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:58,701
Caesar is proud to give you

985
01:55:58,785 --> 01:56:02,621
Aelius Maximus!

986
01:56:15,427 --> 01:56:17,803
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

987
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:21,807
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

988
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:27,396
No, much sooner than that.

989
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:31,108
It's been arranged.

990
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:52,588
We who are about to die salute you.

991
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:57,718
We're with you, Maximus!

992
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,096
Fight on, finish it!

993
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:12,001
Pull, pull!

994
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,909
Loose! Loose!

995
01:59:14,022 --> 01:59:16,106
-Gut him!
-Kill!

996
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:21,153
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

997
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:43,634
-Kill!
-Kill!

998
02:00:21,506 --> 02:00:23,715
Maximus the Merciful!

999
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:38,647
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1000
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:48,490
Forward, arms at ready!

1001
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:20,856
What am I going to do with you?

1002
02:01:22,025 --> 02:01:25,485
You simply won't die.

1003
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:32,618
Are we so different, you and I?

1004
02:01:33,745 --> 02:01:36,663
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1005
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:41,710
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

1006
02:01:42,253 --> 02:01:44,004
Then take it now.

1007
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:59,061
They tell me your son

1008
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:03,774
squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.

1009
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,569
And your wife

1010
02:02:08,821 --> 02:02:10,739
moaned like a whore

1011
02:02:11,866 --> 02:02:16,411
when they ravaged her again and again

1012
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:19,164
and again.

1013
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,173
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,

1014
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:34,137
Highness.

1015
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:04,543
General! General!

1016
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:07,462
General! General!

1017
02:03:09,507 --> 02:03:11,300
-General!
-Cicero!

1018
02:03:18,766 --> 02:03:20,267
-General!
-Where are you camped?

1019
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:21,643
Ostia.

1020
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:31,069
-We love you, Maximus!
-Praise the victor!

1021
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:33,655
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

1022
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:35,615
-Move along!
-Find me!

1023
02:04:01,476 --> 02:04:03,435
Can they hear you?

1024
02:04:07,023 --> 02:04:10,525
-Who?
-Your family, in the afterlife.

1025
02:04:13,029 --> 02:04:15,364
-Yes.
-What do you say to them?

1026
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:20,702
To my boy,

1027
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:25,082
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1028
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:28,752
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1029
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:31,546
To my wife,

1030
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:36,176
that is not your business.

1031
02:04:43,851 --> 02:04:46,728
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

1032
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:51,650
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1033
02:04:52,985 --> 02:04:57,239
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1034
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:00,325
He is defying you.

1035
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:03,787
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1036
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:07,457
The mob sees this,
and so do the Senate.

1037
02:05:08,251 --> 02:05:11,128
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1038
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:14,423
-Kill him.
-No.

1039
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,760
I will not make a martyr of him.

1040
02:05:25,893 --> 02:05:28,353
When I went to the Senate today,

1041
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:32,899
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1042
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:36,987
And did you note what happened?

1043
02:05:37,071 --> 02:05:40,282
-Nothing.
-Exactly. Nothing.

1044
02:05:41,284 --> 02:05:43,618
Not a single word of protest.

1045
02:05:43,703 --> 02:05:47,330
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1046
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:48,582
Why?

1047
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:54,004
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1048
02:05:54,088 --> 02:05:58,133
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1049
02:05:58,593 --> 02:06:02,304
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1050
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:05,599
Then its enemies will approach,

1051
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:08,768
and yet it will lie quite still.

1052
02:06:09,103 --> 02:06:12,898
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

1053
02:06:12,982 --> 02:06:16,276
and yet it remains still.

1054
02:06:19,489 --> 02:06:20,655
So,

1055
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:23,783
we will lie still,

1056
02:06:24,494 --> 02:06:27,829
and let our enemies come to us
and nibble.

1057
02:06:28,998 --> 02:06:31,249
Have every senator followed.

1058
02:06:48,893 --> 02:06:50,644
Cicero, my old friend.

1059
02:06:50,728 --> 02:06:52,604
I thought perhaps I'd seen you
for the last time.

1060
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:55,232
-I thought you were dead.
-Close.

1061
02:06:55,316 --> 02:06:56,942
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1062
02:06:57,026 --> 02:06:58,360
All winter.

1063
02:06:58,694 --> 02:07:01,988
-And how do they look?
-Fat and bored.

1064
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:05,742
-Who's in command?
-Some fool from Rome.

1065
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:09,204
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1066
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:11,081
For you, tomorrow.

1067
02:07:12,542 --> 02:07:15,043
I need you to do something for me.

1068
02:07:19,674 --> 02:07:21,091
Come, see, witness.

1069
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:24,219
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1070
02:07:24,303 --> 02:07:27,931
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1071
02:07:28,015 --> 02:07:30,642
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone,

1072
02:07:30,726 --> 02:07:32,394
by doing this to him, they do...

1073
02:07:33,646 --> 02:07:34,980
My goodness!

1074
02:07:36,774 --> 02:07:40,360
-He got him, he's defeated.
-Give way!

1075
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:49,035
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

1076
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:50,662
-Back.
-My lady.

1077
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:53,164
I served your father at Vindobona.

1078
02:07:53,249 --> 02:07:54,332
Back!

1079
02:07:54,417 --> 02:07:57,627
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1080
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:00,714
Stop. Stop.

1081
02:08:01,257 --> 02:08:02,424
Stop!

1082
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:04,759
Stand back.

1083
02:08:06,053 --> 02:08:09,097
The general sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1084
02:08:10,808 --> 02:08:14,102
-For your loyalty, soldier.
-Thank you, my lady.

1085
02:08:23,863 --> 02:08:25,196
Leave us.

1086
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:32,621
Senator Gracchus.

1087
02:08:46,427 --> 02:08:47,719
General.

1088
02:08:48,804 --> 02:08:51,556
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough

1089
02:08:51,641 --> 02:08:54,726
that you can trust me.

1090
02:08:59,023 --> 02:09:01,483
-The Senate is with you?
-The Senate?

1091
02:09:02,985 --> 02:09:05,695
Yes. I can speak for them.

1092
02:09:06,322 --> 02:09:09,658
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1093
02:09:10,034 --> 02:09:11,493
To what end?

1094
02:09:12,953 --> 02:09:15,288
Get me outside the city walls.

1095
02:09:15,873 --> 02:09:19,751
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1096
02:09:19,835 --> 02:09:23,171
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1097
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:25,507
But the legions
all have new commanders,

1098
02:09:25,591 --> 02:09:27,008
loyal to Commodus.

1099
02:09:27,093 --> 02:09:30,261
Let my men see me alive, and
you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1100
02:09:30,346 --> 02:09:32,013
This is madness.

1101
02:09:32,682 --> 02:09:36,017
No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.

1102
02:09:36,102 --> 02:09:38,353
I will not trade one dictatorship
for another!

1103
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:41,981
The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1104
02:09:42,525 --> 02:09:45,610
And after your glorious coup,
what then?

1105
02:09:46,821 --> 02:09:50,448
You'll take your 5,000 warriors
and leave?

1106
02:09:50,533 --> 02:09:52,075
I will leave.

1107
02:09:52,576 --> 02:09:54,619
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,

1108
02:09:54,704 --> 02:09:56,371
under the command of the Senate.

1109
02:09:56,497 --> 02:09:57,664
So,

1110
02:09:57,998 --> 02:10:02,210
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1111
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:04,587
Tell me why.

1112
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:13,888
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1113
02:10:16,934 --> 02:10:18,810
I will kill Commodus.

1114
02:10:20,729 --> 02:10:23,815
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1115
02:10:25,568 --> 02:10:27,861
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1116
02:10:29,697 --> 02:10:31,739
His daughter trusts you.

1117
02:10:35,744 --> 02:10:37,412
I will trust you.

1118
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:39,873
But we have little time.

1119
02:10:40,416 --> 02:10:42,167
Give me two days,

1120
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:45,211
and I will buy your freedom.

1121
02:10:45,838 --> 02:10:47,172
And you,

1122
02:10:48,716 --> 02:10:50,300
you stay alive,

1123
02:10:51,802 --> 02:10:53,470
or I'll be dead.

1124
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:57,015
Now we must go.

1125
02:11:24,084 --> 02:11:27,670
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1126
02:11:27,755 --> 02:11:29,339
He'll find you.

1127
02:12:13,509 --> 02:12:14,968
It won't work.

1128
02:12:15,928 --> 02:12:18,054
The Emperor knows too much.

1129
02:12:18,806 --> 02:12:19,806
And as for me,

1130
02:12:22,142 --> 02:12:24,185
it's becoming dangerous.

1131
02:12:25,479 --> 02:12:27,730
You'll be paid on my return.

1132
02:12:29,817 --> 02:12:31,609
I give you my word.

1133
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:34,946
Your word? What if you don't return?

1134
02:12:36,198 --> 02:12:39,158
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1135
02:12:39,243 --> 02:12:40,493
Trust?

1136
02:12:44,748 --> 02:12:46,499
Who am I to trust?

1137
02:12:47,084 --> 02:12:50,253
-I will kill Commodus.
-Why would I want that?

1138
02:12:51,046 --> 02:12:52,755
He makes me rich.

1139
02:12:57,886 --> 02:13:00,722
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1140
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:05,059
I know that you would die for honor.

1141
02:13:06,395 --> 02:13:08,354
You would die for Rome.

1142
02:13:09,398 --> 02:13:12,525
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1143
02:13:12,610 --> 02:13:14,902
But I, on the other hand,

1144
02:13:17,615 --> 02:13:19,449
I'm an entertainer.

1145
02:13:22,953 --> 02:13:24,162
Guard!

1146
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:31,586
He killed the man who set you free.

1147
02:13:40,763 --> 02:13:42,597
Praetorians, master.

1148
02:13:48,771 --> 02:13:49,937
Halt!

1149
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:56,879
Where have you been?

1150
02:14:57,339 --> 02:14:58,923
I sent for you.

1151
02:15:00,509 --> 02:15:02,176
Please, brother.

1152
02:15:07,933 --> 02:15:09,809
What's troubling you?

1153
02:15:12,229 --> 02:15:14,605
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1154
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,900
I don't know.

1155
02:15:19,903 --> 02:15:22,029
I thought you'd seen him.

1156
02:15:22,865 --> 02:15:25,366
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1157
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:30,413
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1158
02:15:30,831 --> 02:15:32,874
And he will bleed, too.

1159
02:15:33,751 --> 02:15:35,126
Very soon.

1160
02:15:36,628 --> 02:15:38,296
But not tonight.

1161
02:15:53,312 --> 02:15:56,230
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1162
02:15:57,566 --> 02:15:59,233
"It's a dream,

1163
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:03,029
"a frightful dream,

1164
02:16:05,574 --> 02:16:06,908
"life is."

1165
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,704
Do you think that's true?

1166
02:16:12,456 --> 02:16:13,956
I don't know.

1167
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:19,086
I think it is.

1168
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,592
And I have only you to share it with.

1169
02:17:02,172 --> 02:17:03,798
Open your mouth.

1170
02:17:41,086 --> 02:17:42,879
You know I love you.

1171
02:17:44,965 --> 02:17:46,549
And I love you.

1172
02:18:23,211 --> 02:18:24,754
Out. Get out!

1173
02:18:25,964 --> 02:18:27,214
Move!

1174
02:18:31,887 --> 02:18:33,930
Congratulations, General.

1175
02:18:34,014 --> 02:18:36,807
You've got very persuasive friends.

1176
02:18:42,814 --> 02:18:45,316
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1177
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,861
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1178
02:18:48,946 --> 02:18:52,573
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1179
02:18:53,241 --> 02:18:56,911
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1180
02:18:58,914 --> 02:19:01,207
-You have done all this?
-Yes.

1181
02:19:02,417 --> 02:19:04,126
You risk too much.

1182
02:19:05,087 --> 02:19:07,088
I have much to pay for.

1183
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:11,717
You have nothing to pay for.

1184
02:19:11,802 --> 02:19:14,887
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1185
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,434
I am tired of being strong.

1186
02:19:22,396 --> 02:19:26,607
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1187
02:19:27,109 --> 02:19:30,236
-Because your father chose me.
-No.

1188
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:33,781
Because my father loved you.

1189
02:19:37,703 --> 02:19:40,121
And because I loved you.

1190
02:19:42,708 --> 02:19:44,375
A long time ago.

1191
02:19:49,131 --> 02:19:51,257
Was I very different then?

1192
02:19:57,806 --> 02:19:59,557
You laughed more.

1193
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:06,063
I have felt alone all my life,

1194
02:20:07,357 --> 02:20:09,025
except with you.

1195
02:20:12,112 --> 02:20:13,487
I must go.

1196
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:15,281
Yes.

1197
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:44,977
There.

1198
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:58,032
And I got you.

1199
02:21:01,078 --> 02:21:02,995
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1200
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:05,164
I'm not a legionnaire.

1201
02:21:05,499 --> 02:21:08,084
-Not a legionnaire?
-I'm a gladiator.

1202
02:21:09,377 --> 02:21:10,836
A gladiator?

1203
02:21:11,546 --> 02:21:14,215
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1204
02:21:14,299 --> 02:21:17,718
Wouldn't you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1205
02:21:17,803 --> 02:21:20,387
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1206
02:21:23,225 --> 02:21:25,059
The savior of Rome?

1207
02:21:33,068 --> 02:21:34,777
And who said that?

1208
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:45,204
Where's Lucius?

1209
02:21:46,414 --> 02:21:48,833
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1210
02:21:51,753 --> 02:21:53,462
-She couldn't.
-Yes, she did.

1211
02:21:53,547 --> 02:21:55,756
She took it from a basket,

1212
02:21:57,175 --> 02:22:00,928
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1213
02:22:02,556 --> 02:22:05,766
-It bit her in the breast?
-Yes.

1214
02:22:06,434 --> 02:22:10,396
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies

1215
02:22:10,897 --> 02:22:14,859
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1216
02:22:14,943 --> 02:22:17,528
-I think it's silly.
-So do I.

1217
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:20,948
So do I.

1218
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:23,576
Sister, join us.

1219
02:22:24,202 --> 02:22:25,953
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1220
02:22:26,037 --> 02:22:28,038
-I've been reading, too.
-Yes.

1221
02:22:28,123 --> 02:22:32,459
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1222
02:22:34,004 --> 02:22:36,422
We've been reading about
the great Mark Antony,

1223
02:22:36,506 --> 02:22:37,840
and his adventures in Egypt.

1224
02:22:37,924 --> 02:22:40,467
And the queen killed herself
with a snake.

1225
02:22:40,552 --> 02:22:43,888
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1226
02:22:43,972 --> 02:22:45,806
If you're very good,

1227
02:22:45,891 --> 02:22:49,685
tomorrow night, I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1228
02:22:49,769 --> 02:22:51,478
He was betrayed

1229
02:22:52,689 --> 02:22:54,815
by those closest to him.

1230
02:22:56,693 --> 02:22:58,444
By his own blood.

1231
02:22:59,779 --> 02:23:02,239
They whispered in dark corners

1232
02:23:02,324 --> 02:23:04,783
and went out late at night,

1233
02:23:04,868 --> 02:23:08,204
and conspired, and conspired.

1234
02:23:10,832 --> 02:23:14,668
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1235
02:23:14,794 --> 02:23:17,338
He knew they were busy little bees.

1236
02:23:19,299 --> 02:23:22,343
And one night he sat down
with one of them,

1237
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:25,137
and he looked at her,

1238
02:23:25,889 --> 02:23:27,431
and he said,

1239
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:31,185
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1240
02:23:31,853 --> 02:23:33,562
"busy little bee.

1241
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:38,943
"Or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1242
02:23:40,111 --> 02:23:43,155
"You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood."

1243
02:23:46,868 --> 02:23:49,286
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1244
02:23:51,373 --> 02:23:53,582
The little bee
had wounded him more deeply

1245
02:23:53,667 --> 02:23:56,377
than anyone else could ever have done.

1246
02:23:58,505 --> 02:24:01,382
What do you think happened then,
Lucius?

1247
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:03,842
I don't know, Uncle.

1248
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:12,935
The little bee told him everything.

1249
02:25:10,827 --> 02:25:13,829
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1250
02:25:14,664 --> 02:25:15,956
Proximo!

1251
02:25:16,833 --> 02:25:19,960
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1252
02:25:20,795 --> 02:25:22,129
Proximo!

1253
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:25,799
Open the gates!

1254
02:25:31,639 --> 02:25:33,932
Open the gates, Proximo.

1255
02:25:34,392 --> 02:25:36,643
Do you want to die, old man?

1256
02:25:37,854 --> 02:25:38,979
Here.

1257
02:25:39,564 --> 02:25:41,732
Everything is prepared.

1258
02:25:41,816 --> 02:25:44,276
It seems you have won your freedom.

1259
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:47,946
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1260
02:25:53,036 --> 02:25:56,872
-Juba.
-All enemies of the Emperor die!

1261
02:25:57,415 --> 02:25:59,583
Open the gates!

1262
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,049
Pull!

1263
02:26:09,177 --> 02:26:12,054
Move! Form a column on the left!

1264
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:19,061
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1265
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:21,605
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1266
02:26:21,689 --> 02:26:23,941
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1267
02:26:24,025 --> 02:26:25,818
-Strength and honor.
-Strength and honor.

1268
02:26:25,902 --> 02:26:26,944
Go.

1269
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:29,655
Strength and honor.

1270
02:26:32,283 --> 02:26:35,119
Aim. Arch your bows!

1271
02:27:42,228 --> 02:27:43,520
Shadows and dust.

1272
02:28:25,438 --> 02:28:26,688
Maximus!

1273
02:28:32,153 --> 02:28:33,570
I'm sorry.

1274
02:28:59,973 --> 02:29:01,348
It's done.

1275
02:29:08,314 --> 02:29:10,190
And what of my nephew?

1276
02:29:11,276 --> 02:29:13,277
And what of his mother?

1277
02:29:15,363 --> 02:29:17,906
Should they share her lover's fate?

1278
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:21,660
Or should I be merciful?

1279
02:29:24,372 --> 02:29:26,290
Commodus the Merciful.

1280
02:29:32,714 --> 02:29:35,048
Lucius will stay with me now.

1281
02:29:36,217 --> 02:29:38,010
And if his mother

1282
02:29:39,387 --> 02:29:41,513
so much as looks at me

1283
02:29:42,682 --> 02:29:45,183
in a manner that displeases me,

1284
02:29:47,145 --> 02:29:48,562
he will die.

1285
02:29:52,066 --> 02:29:55,319
If she decides to be noble,

1286
02:29:57,071 --> 02:29:59,156
and takes her own life,

1287
02:30:00,742 --> 02:30:02,200
he will die.

1288
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:07,539
And as for you,

1289
02:30:10,335 --> 02:30:12,085
you will love me,

1290
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,713
as I have loved you.

1291
02:30:16,299 --> 02:30:19,968
You will provide me with an heir
of pure blood,

1292
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,763
so that Commodus

1293
02:30:23,348 --> 02:30:26,308
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1294
02:30:30,938 --> 02:30:32,689
Am I not merciful?

1295
02:30:54,545 --> 02:30:57,172
Am I not merciful!

1296
02:31:09,394 --> 02:31:13,397
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1297
02:31:40,842 --> 02:31:43,593
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1298
02:31:46,347 --> 02:31:50,600
Nothing happens to anyone that
he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1299
02:32:23,551 --> 02:32:24,843
Maximus.

1300
02:32:25,887 --> 02:32:27,220
Maximus.

1301
02:32:28,222 --> 02:32:29,514
Maximus.

1302
02:32:31,225 --> 02:32:33,059
They call for you.

1303
02:32:35,021 --> 02:32:38,273
The general who became a slave.

1304
02:32:39,525 --> 02:32:41,902
The slave who became a gladiator.

1305
02:32:43,279 --> 02:32:46,072
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1306
02:32:48,075 --> 02:32:49,743
A striking story.

1307
02:32:50,912 --> 02:32:54,122
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1308
02:32:56,501 --> 02:32:58,752
Only a famous death will do.

1309
02:33:00,671 --> 02:33:03,215
And what could be more glorious

1310
02:33:03,591 --> 02:33:07,344
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1311
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:12,724
-You would fight me?
-Why not?

1312
02:33:13,809 --> 02:33:15,852
Do you think I'm afraid?

1313
02:33:16,771 --> 02:33:19,814
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1314
02:33:19,899 --> 02:33:23,610
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1315
02:33:29,367 --> 02:33:32,744
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1316
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:36,122
"All a man can do is smile back."

1317
02:33:37,917 --> 02:33:39,334
I wonder,

1318
02:33:39,961 --> 02:33:42,754
did your friend smile at his own death?

1319
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:44,631
You must know.

1320
02:33:47,552 --> 02:33:49,344
He was your father.

1321
02:33:53,224 --> 02:33:55,559
You loved my father, I know,

1322
02:33:57,061 --> 02:33:58,562
but so did I.

1323
02:34:00,189 --> 02:34:02,774
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1324
02:34:05,403 --> 02:34:06,987
Smile for me now, brother.

1325
02:34:12,994 --> 02:34:15,829
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.

1326
02:35:10,259 --> 02:35:12,218
Ring formation!

1327
02:37:03,998 --> 02:37:05,623
Quintus, sword.

1328
02:37:07,126 --> 02:37:08,918
Give me your sword.

1329
02:37:12,339 --> 02:37:14,340
Sword! Give me a sword!

1330
02:37:15,843 --> 02:37:19,345
Sheathe your swords.
Sheathe your swords!

1331
02:39:34,815 --> 02:39:36,149
Maximus.

1332
02:39:41,530 --> 02:39:42,822
Maximus.

1333
02:39:43,407 --> 02:39:44,741
Quintus.

1334
02:39:46,410 --> 02:39:47,869
Free my men.

1335
02:39:49,246 --> 02:39:51,956
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1336
02:39:53,250 --> 02:39:55,335
There was a dream that was Rome.

1337
02:39:56,003 --> 02:39:57,879
It shall be realized.

1338
02:39:58,422 --> 02:40:01,007
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1339
02:40:02,092 --> 02:40:04,093
Free the prisoners. Go!

1340
02:40:28,869 --> 02:40:30,203
Maximus.

1341
02:40:32,081 --> 02:40:33,665
Lucius is safe.

1342
02:40:49,974 --> 02:40:51,391
Go to them.

1343
02:41:41,191 --> 02:41:42,608
You're home.

1344
02:42:09,261 --> 02:42:11,804
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1345
02:42:15,684 --> 02:42:17,477
We believed it once.

1346
02:42:20,689 --> 02:42:22,815
Make us believe it again.

1347
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:28,404
He was a soldier of Rome.

1348
02:42:32,242 --> 02:42:33,659
Honor him.

1349
02:42:34,119 --> 02:42:36,287
Who will help me carry him?

1350
02:43:21,041 --> 02:43:22,708
Now we are free.

1351
02:43:29,091 --> 02:43:30,967
I will see you again.

1352
02:43:33,846 --> 02:43:35,304
But not yet.

1353
02:43:36,306 --> 02:43:42,311
Not yet.

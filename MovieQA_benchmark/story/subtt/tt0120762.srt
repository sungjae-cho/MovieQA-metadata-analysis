Your Majesty, the Huns have
crossed our northern border.

13
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,877
Impossible. No one can get
through the Great Wall.

14
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,785
Shan-Yu is leading them.

15
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,722
We'll set up defenses
around your palace immediately.

16
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,090
No. Send your troops
to protect my people.

17

- Chi Fu.
- Yes, Your Highness?

18
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,299
Deliver conscription notices
throughout all the provinces.

19
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,860
Call up reserves and as many
new recruits as possible.

20
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:56,068
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but
I believe my troops can stop him.

21
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,440
I won't take any chances, General.

22

Father, I brought your... Whoa!

51

- Mulan.
- I brought a spare.

52
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,141
The doctor said three cups
of tea in the morning...

53
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,014
- Mulan.
...and three at night.

54
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,519
Mulan, you should already be in town.

55
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:53,082
We are counting on you
to uphold the family honor.

56
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,560
Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.

57
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,393
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

58
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,631
I'm going to... pray some more.

59
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,267
Fa Li, is your daughter here yet?

60
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,542
The matchmaker
is not a patient woman.

61
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,674
Of all days to be late.

62
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,548
I should have prayed
to the ancestors for luck.

63
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,680
How lucky can they be?
They're dead.

64
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,623
Besides, I've got
all the luck we'll need.

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,629
This is your chance
to prove yourself.

What? But, Mama, I had to...

74
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,894
None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.

It's freezing.

80
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:27,048
It would have been warm
if you were here on time.

Uh, notes.

87
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,331
In case I forget something.

88
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,429
Hold this.
We'll need more luck than I thought.

What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.

But look.
This one's late.

204

But I'll bet that when it blooms,

205
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,978
it will be the most beautiful of all.

[townspeople gasp]

215
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,509
By order of the emperor,

216
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:50,146
one man from every family
must serve in the Imperial army.

217
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,089
The Hsiao family.

218
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,552
The Yi family.

219
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,223
I will serve the emperor
in my father's place.

220
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,562
The Fa family.

221
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,067
No!

222
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,044
I am ready to serve the emperor.

223
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,247
- Father, you can't go.
- Mulan!

224

Please, sir, my father
has already fought bravely...

225
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,151
Silence! You would do well
to teach your daughter

226
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,857
to hold her tongue in a man's presence.

227
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,867
Mulan, you dishonor me.

228
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,405

There are plenty of young men

It is an honor to protect
my country and my family.

So, you'll die for honor.

You must go after her.
She could be killed.

If I reveal her,

264
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,766
she will be.

So, tell me what mortal needs
my protection, Great Ancestor.

- Just say the word and I'm there.
- Mushu...

273

Let me say somethin'. Anybody who's
foolish enough to threaten our family,

274
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,529
vengeance will be mine!

Okay, people, look alive.
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

Let's move it. Rise and shine.

I knew it. I knew it!

That Mulan was a troublemaker
from the start!

290
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,743
Don't look at me. She gets it
from your side of the family.

291
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,008
She's trying to help her father.

292
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,642
If she's discovered,
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.

293
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,279
Dishonor will come to the family.
Traditional values will disintegrate.

294
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:07,416
- Not to mention, they'll lose the farm.
- My children never caused such trouble.

295
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,428
- They all became acupuncturists.
- Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.

296
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,398
No! Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

- Let a guardian bring her back.
- Yes, awaken the most cunning.

00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,841
No, the swiftest.

300
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,639
- No, send the wisest.
- [Great Ancestor] Silence!

301
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,704
We must send
the most powerful of all.

302
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:35,014
[laughing] Okay, okay, I get the drift.
I'll go.

[all laughing]

304
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,388
Y'all don't think I can do it.
Watch this here.

305
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,587
Aha! Jump back.
I'm pretty hot, huh?

306
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,062
Don't make me singe nobody
to prove no point.

307
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,827
You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.

308
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,630
Your misguidance
led Fa Deng to disaster.

309
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,364
Yeah, thanks a lot.

310
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,666
And your point is?

311
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,337
The point is we will be sending
a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.

312
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,642
What? What?
I'm a real dragon!

313
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,978
You are not worthy of this spot.

314
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,213
Now, awaken the great stone dragon.

315
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,851
So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?

316
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,949
[sighs]

317
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,688
Just one chance.
Is that too much to ask?

318
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,993
It's not like it'll kill ya.

319
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,691
Yo, Rocky, wake up!

320
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,861
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!

321
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,837
Come on, boy!
Go get her! Go on!

322
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,241
[whistles] Come on.

323
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:41,242
[growling]

324
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,344
Hello?

325
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,413
Hel-lo!

326
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,583
Hello!

327
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,820
Uh-oh.

328
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,098
Uh, Stony?

329
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,072
Stony? Oh, man, they're gonna kill me.

330
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,734
[Great Ancestor] Great stone dragon,

331
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,506
have you awakened?

332
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,071
[Mushu] Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Yes, I just woke up!

333
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,983
I'm... I am the great stone dragon.
Good morning!

334
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,613
I will go forth and fetch Mulan.

335
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,022
Did... Did I mention that
I was the great stone dragon?

336
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,993
Go! The fate of the Fa family

337
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,724
rests in your claws.

338
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,234
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

339
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,429
[screaming, grunting]

340
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,640
Oh. My elbow!

341
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,232
[groaning] I know I twisted somethin'.

342
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,937
[grunting]

343
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,502
That's just great.
Now what?

344
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,572
I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man

345
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,482
decides to take her
little drag show on the road.

346
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,481
[chirping, squeaking]

347
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,888
Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

348
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,154
After this great stone,
Humpty-Dumpty mess,

349
00:24:56,228 --> 00:25:00,562
I'd have to bring her home with
a medal to get back in the temple.

350
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,759
That's it!
I'll make Mulan a war hero.

351
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,064
They'll be begging me
to come back to work.

352
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,764
That's the master plan.
Ah, you done it now, man.

353
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,898
[chirps]

354
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,101
[chirping continues]

355
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,167
Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?

356
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,837
[chirping]

357
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,904
You're lucky? [laughing]

358
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,507
- Do I look like a sucker to you?
- [chirps]

359
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,211
What you mean, "a loser"?

360
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,880
How 'bout I pop
one of your antennas off?

361
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,549
- Then who's the loser?
- [chirps]

362
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:31,918
[screeching]

363
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:43,731
[whinnying]

364
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:58,680
[both groan]

365
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:01,519
Imperial scouts.

366
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,028
Shan-Yu.

367
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:16,205
[screeches]

368
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:21,667
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun army.

369
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:24,111
[Huns laughing]

370
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,206
The emperor will stop you.

371
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,775
Stop me? He invited me.

372
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:31,548
- [grunts]
- [groans]

373
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:35,113
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

374
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,717
Well, I'm here to play his game.

375
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:43,599
Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.

376
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:46,065
I'm ready.

377
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:52,605
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

378
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,269
One.

379
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,517
Okay, okay, how about this?

380
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,985
[coughs, speaks in deep voice]
Excuse me.

381
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:06,215
Where do I sign in?

382
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:10,385
Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one, too.

383
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,690
They're very manly and... tough.

384
00:27:12,762 --> 00:27:14,389
[neighing]

385
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,695
I'm working on it!

386
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:21,794
Oh. Who am I fooling?

387
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:25,069
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

388
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,975
Did I hear someone
ask for a miracle?

389
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,569
- Let me hear you say "aaah"!
- Aaah!

390
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,842
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.

391
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,317
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

392
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,549
For I have been sent
by your ancestors

393
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:42,183
to guide you through
your masquerade.

394
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,386
If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

395
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:48,761
So heed my word! 'Cause if the army
finds out you're a girl,

396
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:52,199
the penalty is death!

397
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,668
Who are you?

398
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:56,297
Who am I? Who am I?

399
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:59,865
I am the guardian of lost souls.

400
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:02,571
I am the powerful,
the pleasurable,

401
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,137
the indestructible Mushu.

402
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,541
Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?

403
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,584
[groans]

404
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:18,721
Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

405
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,525
Hey, dragon, dragon, not lizard.

406
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:24,226
I don't do that tongue thing.

407
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,269
You're, um...

408
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:28,600
Intimidating?
Awe-inspiring?

409
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:29,934
- Tiny.
- Of course.

410
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:32,065
I'm travel-size
for your convenience.

411
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,873
If I was my real size, your cow
here would die of fright.

412
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:39,905
Down, Bessie. My powers are
beyond your mortal imagination.

413
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:44,750
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor. Oooh!

414
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,986
All right, that's it! Dishonor!

415
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,049
Dishonor on your whole family.

416
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,184
Make a note of this.

417
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,821
Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow, dis...

418
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:56,195
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

419
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:59,531
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

420
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:03,039
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't slap me no more.

421
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,540
We clear on that?
All right.

422
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:08,874
Let's get this show on the road!
Cri-Kee, get the bags.

423
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,379
- Let's move it, heifer.
- [snorts]

424
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,044
[men chattering]

425
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,641
[men chattering]

426
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,448
Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

427
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,786
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

428
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:26,261
Two, three. Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

429
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,034
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- They're disgusting.

430
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:35,469
No, they're men. You have to
act like them, so pay attention.

431
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:39,770
Look.
This tattoo will protect me from harm.

432
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:41,936
Hmm.

433
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:43,639
- [groans]
- [laughing]

434
00:29:43,713 --> 00:29:46,181
I hope you can get your money back!

435
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,410
I don't think I can do this.

436
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:51,147
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

437
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:54,315
- [snorting]
- What are you lookin' at?

438
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:57,155
Punch him.
It's how men say hello.

439
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:01,128
Oh, Yao, you've made a friend.

440
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:03,665
Good. Slap him on the behind.
They like that.

441
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,997
Whoa-ho-ho!

442
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,766
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

443
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,640
- Yao, relax and chant with me.
- [growling]

444
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,044
[chanting]

445
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:21,976
[Yao chanting]

446
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,486
- [gibberish]
- Feel better?

447
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:28,251
Yeah. Ahh, you ain't worth my time.

448
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:30,350
- Chicken boy.
- [screaming] Chicken boy?

449
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:32,691
Say that to my face, ya limp noodle!

450
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:35,356
[growls]

451
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:39,301
Oh. Sorry, Ling.

452
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,837
Hey!

453
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:44,169
Whoa! You're dead!

454
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:49,839
Oh, there he goes!

455
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:56,110
- [clattering]
- [chicken clucking]

456
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,725
[grunting]

457
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:06,591
[men groaning]

458
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:10,665
[Mulan] Hey, guys.

459
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,999
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

460
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,971
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

461
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,737
and stop Shan-Yu before
he destroys this village.

462
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,108
Excellent strategy, sir.

463
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,377
I do love surprises. [chuckling]

464
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,714
You will stay and train
the new recruits.

465
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:32,346
When Chi Fu
believes you're ready,

466
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:34,652
you will join us, Captain.

467
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:36,692
Captain?

468
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,753
[gasps] This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

469
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,821
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience...

470
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,764
Number one in his class,

471
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,132
extensive knowledge
of training techniques,

472
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:49,967
an impressive military lineage.

473
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,803
I believe Li Shang
will do an excellent job.

474
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:57,245
Oh, I will. I won't let you down.
This is... I mean... [clears throat]

475
00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:59,213
- Yes, sir.
- Very good then.

476
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:03,878
We'll toast China's victory
at the imperial city.

477
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:07,218
I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

478
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,418
And I won't leave anything out.

479
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,193
Captain Li Shang.

480
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,324
Hmm. [chuckles]

481
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,233
Leader of China's finest troops.

482
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,602
No. The greatest troops of all time.
[chuckles]

483
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,937
[men yelling]

484
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:30,975
[moaning]

485
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,981
Most impressive.

486
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:41,854
- [whinnies]
- Good luck, Captain. Hyah!

487
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:51,196
Good luck, Father.

488
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:56,767
[yelling, fighting continue]

489
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:58,297
[yelling, fighting continue]

490
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:00,934
Day one.

491
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,672
Soldiers!

492
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:07,613
[together] He started it!

493
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,085
I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

494
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,185
Sorry. Uh...

495
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:23,096
[clears throat] I mean, uh...
sorry you had to see that.

496
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,135
But you know how it is when
you get those manly urges

497
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:28,170
and you just gotta kill something,

498
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:31,867
[groans] Fix things, cook outdoors...

499
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,638
- What's your name?
- [stammering]

500
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:39,307
Your commanding officer
just asked you a question.

501
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:43,716
Uh, I've got a name.
Ha! And it's a boy's name, too.

502
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:46,584
- Ling. How 'bout Ling?
- His name is Ling.

503
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:49,625
I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!

504
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:52,490
- Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.
- Ah Chu.

505
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,587
- Ah Chu?
- Gesundheit.

506
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,097
Ha, ha. I kill myself.

507
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:57,689
- Mushu.
- Mushu?

508
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,359
- No.
- Then what is it?

509
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:01,130
Ping was my best friend growin' up.

510
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,570
- It's Ping.
- Ping?

511
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,733
Of course, Ping did steal my...

512
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:08,140
Yes, my name is Ping.

513
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,839
Let me see
your conscription notice.

514
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:16,181
- Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
- I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

515
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:19,244
Um, he doesn't talk about me much.
[chuckles]

516
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,620
[snorting]

517
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:28,763
I can see why.
The boy's an absolute lunatic.

518
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:31,129
[chuckling]

519
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,533
Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping,

520
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:38,506
you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.

521
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:39,564
[men groan]

522
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,110
And tomorrow, the real work begins.

523
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:45,011
[growls]

524
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:48,244
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

525
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:04,095
[chirping]

526
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,067
[squeaking]

527
00:35:08,237 --> 00:35:09,670
[ringing]

528
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,832
Rise and shine, sleeping beauty.

529
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,206
- Come on. Hup, hup, hup.
- [moans]

530
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:20,314
[Mushu] Get your clothes on.
Get ready. Got breakfast for ya.

531
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:24,979
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

532
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:27,614
Hey, get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

533
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,952
- Am I late?
- No time to talk.

534
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:32,426
It's your first day of training.
Listen to your teacher and no fightin'.

535
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,963
Play nice, unless one of the other kids
wanna fight.

536
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:37,056
Then you have to kick
the other kid's butt.

537
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,158
I don't wanna kick
the other kid's butt.

538
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:43,228
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Let's see your war face.

539
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,638
I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.

540
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,369
Come on! Scare me, girl.

541
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,434
- [growls]
- Yeah!

542
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:53,004
That's my tough-lookin' warrior.
Get out there and make me proud.

543
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:54,344
[neighing]

544
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:55,941
[snorting]

545
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:58,317
- The troops just left?
- They what?

546
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,916
[muffled shouting]

547
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:04,186
Wait! You forgot your sword.

548
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,025
My little baby,
off to destroy people.

549
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,190
[whimpers]

550
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:14,065
[man screams]

551
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:16,537
Order. People, order.

552
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:19,473
- I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
- Oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.

553
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:22,010
- Moo goo gai pan.
- That's not funny!

554
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:24,308
[braying]

555
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,543
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

556
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:31,212
Hello, Ping.
Are ya hungry?

557
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:34,984
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

558
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,151
- [men shouting]
- [Li Shang] Soldiers!

559
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,766
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

560
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,693
Anyone who acts otherwise

561
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,762
will answer to me.

562
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,775
Ooh. Tough guy.

563
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:54,935
Yao.

564
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:04,279
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

565
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:05,615
[knuckles cracking]

566
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:08,316
I'll get that arrow, pretty boy,

567
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,792
and I'll do it with my shirt on.

568
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,560
One moment.
You seem to be missing something.

569
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,367
This represents discipline,

570
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:27,508
and this represents strength.

571
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:32,105
You need both to reach the arrow.

572
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:41,049
[grunting]

573
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:51,890

00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:33,515
[Shan-Yu] What do you see?

632
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:37,116
Black pine, from the high mountains.

633
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:41,121
White horse hair.
Imperial stallions.

634
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,360
[sniffing] Sulfur, from cannons.

635
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:48,335
This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass,

636
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:50,634
where the imperial army
is waiting for us.

637
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:52,936
We can avoid them easily.

638
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,467
No.

639
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:59,844
The quickest way to the
emperor is through that pass.

640
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:04,716
And besides, the little girl
will be missing her doll.

641
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:06,914
We should return it to her.

642
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,320
[stammering] No, this is not
a good idea.

643
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:17,059
What if somebody sees you?

644
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:20,534
Just because I look like a man
doesn't mean I have to smell like one.

645
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:23,367
So a couple of guys
don't rinse out their socks.

that corn chip smell.

- Ahhh.
- All right. That's enough.

649

go stand watch.

Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't know you were here.

662
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:20,017
I was just washing. So now I'm
clean, and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.

663
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:21,563
Come back here.

664
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,190
I know we were jerks to you before,

665
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,734
so let's start over.

666
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:29,999
- Hi. I'm Ling.
- [nervous chuckle]

667
00:43:30,072 --> 00:43:33,473

- Hello, Chien-Po.

00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:36,670
And I am Yao!

669
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:38,736

670
00:43:38,814 --> 00:43:42,250
And there's nothin'
you girls can do about it.

671
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,084
Oh, yeah? Well, I think Ping
and I can take you.

672
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,146
I really don't wanna
take him anywhere.

673
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:49,589
Ping, we have to fight!

674
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:51,558
No, we don't.

675
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:54,960
We could just close
our eyes and swim around.

676
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,362
- Come on. Don't be such a gir...
- [crunching]

677
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:58,832
Ouch! Something bit me!

678
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:01,461
[grunts, coughs] What a nasty flavor.

679
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:04,802

683
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:17,240
Some king of the rock. Aah!

684
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:19,378
Boy, that was close.

685
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:22,083
No. That was vile.

686
00:44:22,158 --> 00:44:24,752
You owe me big.

687
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:28,820
I never want to see a naked man again.

688
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,025

00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:35,227
Hey, don't look at me.

691
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:37,795
I ain't bitin' no more butts.

692
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:40,603
[Chi Fu] You think your troops
are ready to fight?

693
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:44,203
Ha! They would not last
a minute against the Huns!

694
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,077
They completed their training.

695
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:49,515
Those boys are no more fit
to be soldiers

696
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,382
than you are to be captain.

697
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:53,978
Once the general reads my report,

698
00:44:54,056 --> 00:44:56,684
your troops will never see battle.

699
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,748
Oh, no, you don't!

700
00:44:57,826 --> 00:45:00,454
I've worked too hard
to get Mulan into this war.

701
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:02,360
This guy's messin' with my plan.

702
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:04,490
We're not finished!

703
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:05,727
Be careful, Captain.

704
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:07,894
The general may be your father,

705
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,871
but I am the emperor's counsel.

706
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,965
[scoffs] And, oh, by the way,

707
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:15,909
I got that job on my own.

708
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:18,640
You're dismissed.

709
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:23,350
Hey. I'll hold him, and you punch.

710
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:27,014
[chuckles] Or not.

711
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:31,617
For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.

712
00:45:36,966 --> 00:45:39,127
- I saw that.
- What?

713
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:41,635
You like him, don't you?

714
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:44,332
- No! I...
- Yeah, right, sure.

715
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:46,067
Go to your tent!

716
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:51,841
I think it's time we took this war

717
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:52,904
I think it's time we took this war

718
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:55,075
into our own hands.

Let me see what you got.

724
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:17,929
"From General Li. Dear son,
we're waiting for Huns at the pass.

725
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:20,134
It would mean a lot
if you'd come back us up."

726
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:23,576
That's great. Except you forgot,
"Since we're out of potpourri,

727
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:25,807
perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing some."

728
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:28,714
Hello! This is the army!
Make it sound more urgent!

729
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:30,149
Know what I'm talkin' about?

That's better.
Much better. Let's go.

Hey, we need a ride.

And I do not squeal like a girl.
[high-pitched squeal]

Urgent news from the general.

742
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:06,821
What's the matter? You've never
seen a black and white before?

743
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:11,351
Who are you?

744
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:15,420
Excuse me?
I think the question is, who are you?

745
00:47:15,497 --> 00:47:18,295
We're in a war, man!
There's no time for stupid questions!

746
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:21,768
I should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.

747
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:25,705
But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.

00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,391
Ping! What's wrong?

875
00:59:33,465 --> 00:59:35,296
[grunting]

876
00:59:37,135 --> 00:59:39,865
He's wounded! Get help!

877
00:59:39,938 --> 00:59:42,930
- [chattering]
- Ping.

878
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:44,999
Hold on.

879
00:59:45,077 --> 00:59:46,942
Hold on.

880
01:00:01,893 --> 01:00:04,794
[whispering]

881
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,739
I can explain.

882
01:00:18,977 --> 01:00:21,445
[gasping] So it's true!

883
01:00:21,513 --> 01:00:23,845
[Mulan] Shang!

884
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:26,748
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

885
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:29,252
- A woman!
- [gasping]

886
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:32,381
- [grunting]
- Treacherous snake!

887
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:34,857
My name is Mulan.

888
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:38,453
- I did it to save my father.
- High treason!

889
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,555
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

890
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,793
Ultimate dishonor!

891
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:46,531
It was the only way.
Please, believe me.

892
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:49,836
[scoffs] Captain?

893
01:00:54,746 --> 01:00:56,577
- [neighing]
- [gasps]

894
01:00:56,648 --> 01:00:59,116
Restrain him!

895
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:04,319
- [together] No!
- You know the law.

896
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:19,069
A life for a life.

897
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,435
My debt is repaid.

898
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:26,834
- Move out!
- But you can't just...

899
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:29,779
I said move out.

900
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,602
[snorts]

901
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,237
[nickers]

902
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,075
[chirping, chittering]

903
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,675
I was this close.

904
01:02:07,753 --> 01:02:10,984
This close to impressin' the ancestors,

905
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:13,752
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.

906
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:17,352
Man. All my fine work. Pfft.

907
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,166
Hi.

908
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:26,261
I should never have left home.

909
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:29,432
Hey, come on.
You went to save your father's life.

910
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:32,602
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him,
disgracing your ancestors

911
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:36,408
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gotta...

912
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:38,415
you gotta learn
to let these things go.

913
01:02:38,483 --> 01:02:40,542
[crying]

914
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,179
Maybe I didn't go for my father.

915
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,246
Maybe what I really wanted

916
01:02:45,323 --> 01:02:48,087
was to prove I could do things right.

917
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,960
So when I looked in the mirror,

918
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,521
I'd see someone worthwhile.

919
01:02:57,135 --> 01:02:58,796
But I was wrong.

920
01:03:00,138 --> 01:03:02,436
I see nothing.

921
01:03:11,516 --> 01:03:14,542
That's just 'cause this needs
a little spit, that's all.

922
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:18,020
[spits] Let me shine this up for ya.

923
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:21,252
I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

924
01:03:26,064 --> 01:03:28,794
The truth is, we're both frauds.

925
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:31,927
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

926
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:34,733
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

927
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,774
I risked your life to help myself.

928
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:39,709
At least you had good intentions.

929
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:42,906
[soft chirping]

930
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:45,541
What? What do you mean
you're not lucky?

931
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:48,518
- You lied to me?
- [chirping]

932
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:50,782
And what are you, a sheep?

933
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:52,847
- [grumbles]
- Ah!

934
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:56,018
I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.

935
01:03:58,029 --> 01:03:59,519
Let's go home.

936
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:02,931
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.

937
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:07,028
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

938
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:10,734
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll finish it.

939
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:15,011
I promise.

940
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,850
[screeching]

941
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,668

945
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,554
[grunting]

946
01:05:05,797 --> 01:05:07,890
[both grunting]

947
01:05:07,966 --> 01:05:10,434
[growling]

948
01:05:12,737 --> 01:05:14,932
[screeching]

01:05:31,289 --> 01:05:33,154
[gasps]

950
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:39,388
Uh, home is that way.

951
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:42,763
- I have to do something.
- Did you see those Huns?

952
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:45,701
They popped out of the snow!
Like daisies!

953
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:48,898
Are we in this together or not?

954
01:05:49,975 --> 01:05:52,409
[chirping]

955
01:05:52,477 --> 01:05:55,913
Well, let's go kick some Hunny buns!

956
01:05:55,981 --> 01:05:58,006
Yee-haw!

957
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:00,313
[whooping]

958
01:06:07,592 --> 01:06:09,992
[crowd cheering]

959
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:21,068
Make way for the heroes of China.

960
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:37,719
- Shang!
- Mulan?

961
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:40,223
The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

962
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,953
You don't belong here, Mulan.
Go home.

963
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:49,656
I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

964
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:51,326
Why should I?

965
01:06:54,773 --> 01:06:57,537
- [whinnying]
- Why else would I come back?

966
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:02,342
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

967
01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:14,416
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here. Yah!

968
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:24,734
- [crowd cheering]
- Now where are you going?

969
01:07:24,803 --> 01:07:27,397
To find someone
who will believe me.

970
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,200
My children,
heaven smiles down

971
01:08:02,273 --> 01:08:04,503
upon the Middle Kingdom.

972
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:08,273
China will sleep safely tonight

973
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:11,076
thanks to our brave warriors.

974
01:08:11,149 --> 01:08:13,117
[crowd cheering]

975
01:08:14,185 --> 01:08:16,619
- Sir, the emperor's in danger.
- [harrumphs]

976
01:08:16,688 --> 01:08:18,918
But the Huns are here.

977
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:21,788
- Please, you have to help.
- [harrumphs]

978
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:25,026
No one will listen.

979
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:27,326
Huh? I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

980
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:31,129
- Mushu.
- You're a girl again, remember?

981
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:33,136
Your Majesty,

982
01:08:33,204 --> 01:08:36,833
I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

983
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:40,275
I know what this means to you,
Captain Li.

984
01:08:40,345 --> 01:08:43,974
Your father would have been very proud.

985
01:08:44,048 --> 01:08:45,675
[screeching]

986
01:08:47,986 --> 01:08:49,544

[growling]

990
01:09:10,975 --> 01:09:13,967
- No!
- Come on!

991
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:21,382
[cackling]

992
01:09:21,452 --> 01:09:23,852
[groaning]

993
01:09:31,162 --> 01:09:33,756
They'll never reach the emperor in time.

994
01:09:33,832 --> 01:09:35,766
[battering continues]

995
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:40,037
[whistling] Hey, guys!

996
01:09:40,104 --> 01:09:42,538
I've got an idea.

997
01:09:56,521 --> 01:09:58,250
# <i>Be a man</i>

998
01:09:58,323 --> 01:10:01,121
# <i>We must be swift as a coursing river</i>

999
01:10:01,192 --> 01:10:02,557
# <i>Be a man</i>

1000
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:04,720
# <i>With all the force of a great typhoon</i>

1001
01:10:04,796 --> 01:10:06,263
# <i>Be a man</i>

1002
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:09,926
# <i>With all the strength of a raging fire</i>

1003
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:14,700
# <i>Mysterious as the dark side</i>
<i>Of the moon</i> #

1004
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:24,905
[people exclaiming, gasping]

1005
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:29,953
Boo.

1006
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:31,488
Guard the door.

1007
01:10:37,595 --> 01:10:40,530
Your walls and armies have fallen,

1008
01:10:40,598 --> 01:10:42,896
and now it's your turn.

1009
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:44,867
Bow to me.

1010
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,399
Okay. Any questions?

1011
01:10:51,476 --> 01:10:53,467
[Yao] Does this dress make me look fat?

1012
01:10:53,544 --> 01:10:55,375
- [slap]
- Ow!

1013
01:10:55,446 --> 01:10:57,641
- [girlish giggling]
- Who's there?

1014
01:10:57,715 --> 01:11:00,309
[giggling]

1015
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:03,843
- Concubines.
- Ugly concubines.

1016
01:11:03,922 --> 01:11:05,412
Oh, he's so cute!

1017
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:14,598
Ohh...

1018
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,861

[squawking]

1020
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:20,296
Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.

1021
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:22,066
[chuckling]

1022
01:11:38,222 --> 01:11:39,814
Shang, go!

1023
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,627
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

1024
01:11:44,662 --> 01:11:47,094
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

1025
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:52,933
No matter how the wind howls,
the mountain cannot bow to it.

1026
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:56,940
Then you will kneel in pieces!

1027
01:12:09,153 --> 01:12:11,383
Chien-Po, get the emperor!

1028
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,084
Sorry, Your Majesty.

1029
01:12:15,393 --> 01:12:16,417
[grunting]

1030
01:12:17,895 --> 01:12:19,192
No!

1031
01:12:28,706 --> 01:12:30,071
Come on!

01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:35,872

01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:47,889
No.

01:12:50,194 --> 01:12:54,028
[growling]

1037
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,631
You!

1038
01:13:02,073 --> 01:13:04,439
You took away my victory!

1039
01:13:04,509 --> 01:13:05,976
[Mulan] No!

1040
01:13:06,911 --> 01:13:07,969
I did.

1041
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:14,179
The soldier from the mountains.

1042
01:13:19,657 --> 01:13:21,022
[yelling]

1043
01:13:24,228 --> 01:13:26,594
- [squawking]
- [Mushu] So what's the plan?

1044
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:28,859
- Um...
- You don't have a plan?

1045
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:32,801
Hey, I'm making this up as I... go.

1046
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,338
- Mushu!
- Way ahead of you, sister.

1047
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:37,670
Come on, Cri-Kee.

1048
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:44,413
[gasping]

1049
01:13:48,086 --> 01:13:50,179
[screaming]

1050
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,821
- Citizens, I need firepower.
- [gasping] Who are you?

1051
01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:02,297
Your worst nightmare!

1052
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:07,762
- On the roof!
- Look!

1053
01:14:15,046 --> 01:14:17,014
[gasping]

1054
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:28,116
It looks like you're out of ideas.

1055
01:14:30,962 --> 01:14:32,520
Not quite.

1056
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,895
Ready, Mushu?

1057
01:14:34,966 --> 01:14:38,402
I am ready, baby!
Light me.

1058
01:14:38,469 --> 01:14:40,960
[growling]

1059
01:14:47,512 --> 01:14:50,481
Huh? [gasps]

1060
01:14:50,548 --> 01:14:52,778
[screams]

1061
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,182
Get off the roof, get off the roof,
get off the roof.

1062
01:15:06,564 --> 01:15:08,464
[grunting]

1063
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:13,933
[laughing]

1064
01:15:14,005 --> 01:15:17,133
- You are a lucky bug.
- [squeaking]

1065
01:15:19,177 --> 01:15:21,975
[crowd cheering]

1066
01:15:24,182 --> 01:15:26,878
That was a deliberate attempt
on my life!

1067
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:29,579
Where is she?
Now she's done it.

1068
01:15:29,654 --> 01:15:32,020
What a mess!
Stand aside!

1069
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:35,286
That creature's not worth protecting.

1070
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,350
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.

1071
01:15:37,428 --> 01:15:40,522
- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous...

1072
01:15:40,598 --> 01:15:43,692
That is enough.

1073
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:51,436
Your Majesty, I can explain.

1074
01:15:59,217 --> 01:16:03,017
I've heard a great deal about you,
Fa Mulan.

1075
01:16:04,388 --> 01:16:06,379
You stole your father's armor,

1076
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:08,687
ran away from home,

1077
01:16:08,759 --> 01:16:10,852
impersonated a soldier,

1078
01:16:10,928 --> 01:16:13,294
deceived your commanding officer,

1079
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:17,630
dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace...

1080
01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:19,465
and...

1081
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:22,665
you have saved us all.

1082
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,040
Ah! Ooh!

1083
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:53,126
[Mushu sniffles]

1084
01:16:53,204 --> 01:16:57,573
My little baby is all grown up
and... and savin' China.

1085
01:16:57,642 --> 01:16:59,542
You have a tissue?

1086
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:05,338
- Chi Fu.
- Your Excellency?

1087
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:08,749
See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.

1088
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:11,344
Member... what?
[stammering] But...

1089
01:17:11,422 --> 01:17:16,121
There are no council positions open,
Your Majesty.

1090
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:18,991
Very well.
You can have his job.

1091
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:21,827
What? I... Oh.

1092
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:27,027
With all due respect,
Your Excellency,

1093
01:17:27,104 --> 01:17:29,834
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

1094
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:32,205
Then... take this,

1095
01:17:32,276 --> 01:17:36,906
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

1096
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:39,040
And this,

1097
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:44,520
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

1098
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:49,756
[emperor chuckles]

1099
01:17:49,827 --> 01:17:52,921
Is she allowed to do that?

1100
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,072
[crying]

1101
01:18:06,777 --> 01:18:09,974
Um... you...

1102
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:12,572
You fight good.

1103
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,517
Oh. Thank you.

1104
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:21,084
[groans]

1105
01:18:24,028 --> 01:18:26,758
Khan, let's go home.

1106
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:30,699
[crowd cheers]

1107
01:18:31,969 --> 01:18:33,960
[clears throat]

1108
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:37,496
The flower that blooms in adversity

1109
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:41,204
is the most rare and beautiful of all.

1110
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:42,267
Sir?

1111
01:18:42,346 --> 01:18:46,305
You don't meet a girl
like that every dynasty.

1112
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:18,809
Mulan!

1113
01:19:18,883 --> 01:19:22,614
Father, I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

1114
01:19:24,088 --> 01:19:26,886
And the crest of the emperor.

1115
01:19:28,225 --> 01:19:31,752
They're gifts,
to honor the Fa family.

1116
01:19:38,235 --> 01:19:43,537
The greatest gift and honor
is having you for a daughter.

1117
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:47,275
I've missed you so.

1118
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:49,574
I've missed you, too, Baba.

1119
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,618
- [sighs]
- Great. She brings a sword.

1120
01:19:58,689 --> 01:20:01,317
If you ask me, she should've
brought home a man.

1121
01:20:01,392 --> 01:20:02,381
Excuse me.

1122
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,826
Does Fa Mulan live here?

1123
01:20:07,264 --> 01:20:08,629
Thank you.

1124
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:12,135
Whoo! Sign me up for the next war!

1125
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:17,563
Honorable Fa Zhou, I...
Mulan!

1126
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:20,940
Uh... you forgot your helmet.

1127
01:20:21,011 --> 01:20:24,037
W-well, actually,
it's your helmet, isn't it?

1128
01:20:24,114 --> 01:20:25,775
I mean...

1129
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,182
Would you like to stay for dinner?

1130
01:20:28,252 --> 01:20:31,688
[Grandmother] Would you
like to stay forever?

1131
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:33,746
Dinner would be great.

1132
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:39,856
Come on.
Who did a good job?

1133
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,330
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

1134
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,995
Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.

1135
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:50,871
Aah-ha!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1136
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,273
Take it, Cri-Kee!

1137
01:20:58,349 --> 01:21:00,544
[whooping]

1138
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:03,746
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

1139
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:10,652
[Mushu]
Call out for egg rolls!

1140
01:21:10,728 --> 01:21:14,425
- [yelping]
- Guardians.

1141
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:18,157
- Oh.
- Thanks, Mushu.

1142
01:21:19,703 --> 01:21:21,796
[barking]

1143
01:21:21,872 --> 01:21:25,308
- [clucking]
- [Great Ancestor] Mushu!

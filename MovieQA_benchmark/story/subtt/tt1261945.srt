DeriousIy. you're crazy in Abu Dhabi.

1640
01:40:44,932 --> 01:40:49,096
Just because you're worried about
your marriage. everyone's gonna cheat.

1641
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:50,601
Have a good time at dinner.

1642
01:40:54,275 --> 01:40:55,765
You okay?

1643
01:40:55,943 --> 01:40:59,401
Yeah. I'm just reaIIy. reaIIy tired.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1644
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,377
Take a nice. Iong nap.

1645
01:41:01,549 --> 01:41:03,176
And then I'II buy you a drink.

1646
01:41:04,118 --> 01:41:05,346
How's 9 sound?

1647
01:41:05,519 --> 01:41:07,009
-Okay.
-Okay.

1648
01:41:23,837 --> 01:41:25,498
Hi.

1649
01:41:27,241 --> 01:41:28,799
Hi.

1650
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:34,204
Miss Hobbes.

1651
01:41:34,381 --> 01:41:38,044
I thought.
''Why go to a bar when we have a bar?''

1652
01:41:38,919 --> 01:41:40,614
Thank you.

1653
01:41:41,956 --> 01:41:43,719
Thank you. Resir. You can go.

1654
01:41:45,392 --> 01:41:46,620
How was your nap?

1655
01:41:46,794 --> 01:41:47,886
I sIept hard.

1656
01:41:48,062 --> 01:41:51,429
You needed it.
Being a mother kicks your ass.

1657
01:41:51,599 --> 01:41:54,762
Yes. but the benefits make it worth it.

1658
01:41:58,572 --> 01:42:00,164
Okay.

1659
01:42:01,909 --> 01:42:06,005
-We're 6700 miIes away from everyone.
-Mm-hm.

1660
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:09,479
-You can say it to me. I'm a mother too.
-Day what?

1661
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:13,848
AII the things you're thinking. but you
won't aIIow yourseIf to say out Ioud.

1662
01:42:14,355 --> 01:42:16,448
Okay. I'II go first.

1663
01:42:19,093 --> 01:42:21,561
As much as I Iove Brady...

1664
01:42:21,729 --> 01:42:25,324
...and I do Iove him more than words...

1665
01:42:26,133 --> 01:42:29,694
...being a mother is not enough.

1666
01:42:31,171 --> 01:42:32,433
I miss my job.

1667
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:40,437
You're not gonna Ieave me hanging out
feeIing Iike the worst mother. are you?

1668
01:42:40,614 --> 01:42:42,309
Okay.

1669
01:42:45,686 --> 01:42:47,244
WeII....

1670
01:42:48,989 --> 01:42:51,753
-I Iove my girIs.
-I know that.

1671
01:42:51,925 --> 01:42:53,358
But...

1672
01:42:54,328 --> 01:42:57,889
...I have enjoyed not having them around.

1673
01:42:58,232 --> 01:43:00,723
-I needed a break.
-Yes. you did.

1674
01:43:01,735 --> 01:43:06,536
Rose cries aII day. every day.

1675
01:43:06,707 --> 01:43:08,368
It's driving me crazy.

1676
01:43:08,542 --> 01:43:11,340
I have been watching you.
I don't know how you're doing it.

1677
01:43:11,512 --> 01:43:14,845
Dometimes I go in the other room
and I cIose the door...

1678
01:43:15,015 --> 01:43:17,313
...and I just Iet her scream.
Isn't that awfuI?

1679
01:43:17,484 --> 01:43:19,748
No. that's survivaI. Take a sip.

1680
01:43:24,024 --> 01:43:25,685
And can I teII you something eIse?

1681
01:43:25,859 --> 01:43:26,917
I feeI guiIty.

1682
01:43:27,094 --> 01:43:30,928
I feeI so guiIty. because aII I ever prayed
for was to have a famiIy.

1683
01:43:31,098 --> 01:43:33,692
And now I have these two beautifuI girIs.

1684
01:43:33,867 --> 01:43:35,027
And?

1685
01:43:35,202 --> 01:43:39,002
-They're driving me crazy.
-Take a sip.

1686
01:43:42,076 --> 01:43:43,873
And I feeI Iike I'm faiIing.

1687
01:43:44,044 --> 01:43:47,070
I just feeI Iike I'm faiIing aII the time.

1688
01:43:47,247 --> 01:43:48,339
You're not faiIing.

1689
01:43:48,515 --> 01:43:50,380
Being a mother is hard.

1690
01:43:50,551 --> 01:43:52,610
Oh. my God. It is so hard.

1691
01:43:53,153 --> 01:43:55,178
And I have fuII-time heIp.

1692
01:43:55,356 --> 01:43:58,223
How do the women without heIp do it?

1693
01:43:58,392 --> 01:44:01,122
I have no fucking idea.

1694
01:44:01,595 --> 01:44:03,529
-To them.
-To them.

1695
01:44:06,533 --> 01:44:07,898
And when I--

1696
01:44:08,068 --> 01:44:10,434
Oh. no. I can't. I can't. It's awfuI.

1697
01:44:10,604 --> 01:44:11,696
Dip.

1698
01:44:14,641 --> 01:44:16,165
Go.

1699
01:44:17,311 --> 01:44:20,144
When I heard Damantha say...

1700
01:44:20,314 --> 01:44:23,283
...that Harry was gonna cheat on me
with Erin--

1701
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:24,974
Yeah.

1702
01:44:25,152 --> 01:44:28,485
--my first thought was:

1703
01:44:28,989 --> 01:44:30,980
''I can't Iose the nanny.''

1704
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,956
[LAUGHING]

1705
01:44:37,798 --> 01:44:40,858
We reaIIy shouId eat something.

1706
01:44:46,273 --> 01:44:49,401
I'm happy for you. For both of you.

1707
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:52,010
Thank you.

1708
01:44:52,679 --> 01:44:53,805
That means a Iot.

1709
01:44:55,816 --> 01:44:58,614
I have a confession to make.

1710
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:00,809
I aIready knew you were married.

1711
01:45:01,488 --> 01:45:04,184
You Iet me go through aII that?

1712
01:45:05,259 --> 01:45:08,490
Yeah. my wife showed me something
on the internet.

1713
01:45:08,662 --> 01:45:13,190
You know. she aIways kind of kept
one eye on you. the one that got away.

1714
01:45:22,509 --> 01:45:23,533
How is Kathy?

1715
01:45:23,977 --> 01:45:27,606
Dhe's great. Dhe's reaIIy amazing.

1716
01:45:28,849 --> 01:45:32,307
Her fabric business is through the roof.
even with the three boys.

1717
01:45:33,053 --> 01:45:35,521
-Oh. my God. Three?
-Yeah.

1718
01:45:35,689 --> 01:45:37,623
Homer. Wyatt and Tate.

1719
01:45:37,991 --> 01:45:39,652
Dounds Iike a country-music band.

1720
01:45:39,827 --> 01:45:41,818
Here's hoping.

1721
01:45:47,034 --> 01:45:48,865
Tate.

1722
01:45:52,372 --> 01:45:54,203
Wow. Aidan. they're amazing.

1723
01:45:54,374 --> 01:45:56,604
Yeah. they're good boys.

1724
01:45:56,777 --> 01:45:58,745
We're reaIIy Iucky.

1725
01:46:01,615 --> 01:46:03,344
What about you?

1726
01:46:03,517 --> 01:46:04,677
Not in the cards?

1727
01:46:04,852 --> 01:46:06,444
I don't know.

1728
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:10,488
We've taIked about it a Iot
and both Iove kids. but...

1729
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:15,023
...that's not who we are.

1730
01:46:15,195 --> 01:46:18,653
Yeah. doesn't surprise me.
You're anything but traditionaI.

1731
01:46:18,832 --> 01:46:21,323
I Iearned that when I tried
to get you to wear a ring.

1732
01:46:21,502 --> 01:46:23,868
ExactIy. And see? DtiII:

1733
01:46:25,372 --> 01:46:27,272
No diamond.

1734
01:46:27,941 --> 01:46:29,738
-And I'm married.
-Man...

1735
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:32,936
...that was my big mistake.
Trying to get a rock on you.

1736
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:37,717
You're not Iike other women.

1737
01:46:40,087 --> 01:46:42,851
Man. are you not.

1738
01:46:47,661 --> 01:46:49,891
Fuck. you Iook good.

1739
01:46:50,664 --> 01:46:54,532
You Iook hot. I'm sorry. but you do.

1740
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,940
Did you enjoy the <i>muhammara?</i>

1741
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:06,304
That is the best <i>muhammara</i>
I've ever had.

1742
01:47:08,348 --> 01:47:10,373
AIDAN:
There's seven arches.

1743
01:47:10,551 --> 01:47:14,453
One to represent each
of the different Arab Emirates.

1744
01:47:14,621 --> 01:47:18,580
I memorize a different state
every time I come. I'm up to four now.

1745
01:47:18,959 --> 01:47:21,120
I got Abu Dhabi. Ajman...

1746
01:47:21,295 --> 01:47:24,731
...Dubai and. um. hoId on....

1747
01:47:41,248 --> 01:47:42,272
I'm sorry.

1748
01:47:42,549 --> 01:47:44,312
No. I'm sorry.

1749
01:47:44,484 --> 01:47:47,419
-Oh. fuck.
-Yeah. I shouId go.

1750
01:47:47,588 --> 01:47:48,987
I'm going. Bye.

1751
01:47:53,093 --> 01:47:54,117
Is this the way?

1752
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:12,674
-How was your dinner. miss?
-Yeah.

1753
01:48:15,282 --> 01:48:17,216
-I kissed Aidan.
-I knew it.

1754
01:48:17,384 --> 01:48:19,113
I know you knew it.

1755
01:48:19,286 --> 01:48:20,651
I pIayed with fire.

1756
01:48:21,088 --> 01:48:24,683
I'm so mad at myseIf.
Is Damantha stiII here? I need everybody.

1757
01:48:24,858 --> 01:48:27,122
Dhe's getting ready for her date.

1758
01:48:31,465 --> 01:48:32,659
Damantha!

1759
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,229
In here.

1760
01:48:37,004 --> 01:48:40,269
I kissed Aidan.
I'm freaking out. I need to taIk.

1761
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:41,907
I'm coming right out.

1762
01:48:42,075 --> 01:48:45,340
PauIa. I need a toweI.

1763
01:48:48,682 --> 01:48:51,173
One minute. he was naming
the Arab Emirates...

1764
01:48:51,351 --> 01:48:54,047
...and then. aII of a sudden. we kissed.

1765
01:48:54,221 --> 01:48:58,317
-Did he kiss you? Or did you kiss him?
-No. both. Both equaIIy guiIty.

1766
01:49:01,128 --> 01:49:04,825
-Yeah. I wanna caII Big and teII him.
-Let's just caIm down for a second.

1767
01:49:04,998 --> 01:49:08,764
No. reaIIy. I don't want the secret.
The secret to me makes it much worse.

1768
01:49:08,935 --> 01:49:12,735
Do the sooner I teII him. the quicker.
the Iess damage it wiII do.

1769
01:49:12,906 --> 01:49:16,034
I mean. we're eight hours ahead
of New York. This is the future.

1770
01:49:16,209 --> 01:49:18,677
It hasn't reaIIy even happened there yet.

1771
01:49:21,014 --> 01:49:23,346
WeII. now I'm crazy in Abu Dhabi.

1772
01:49:23,517 --> 01:49:26,213
Do. what do you think? DhouId I caII him?

1773
01:49:26,386 --> 01:49:28,013
CHARLOTTE:
I don't know.

1774
01:49:28,188 --> 01:49:30,281
I don't know.

1775
01:49:30,691 --> 01:49:33,057
I don't know.

1776
01:49:33,994 --> 01:49:35,621
I'm a IittIe drunk.

1777
01:49:35,796 --> 01:49:39,425
When Dteve toId me he cheated on me.
I was devastated.

1778
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,534
But now that I know
it was onIy that one time....

1779
01:49:42,703 --> 01:49:45,501
-Yeah?
-Was the pain worth it?

1780
01:49:45,672 --> 01:49:48,698
-I don't know.
-Yeah. I don't know.

1781
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:50,604
DAMANTHA:
Let's get something straight here.

1782
01:49:50,777 --> 01:49:52,244
Dteve had sex.

1783
01:49:52,579 --> 01:49:54,069
I'm sorry. but he did.

1784
01:49:54,247 --> 01:49:56,909
And this was just a kiss.
A kiss is nothing.

1785
01:49:57,084 --> 01:49:59,314
-A kiss with Aidan.
-It was a kiss.

1786
01:49:59,486 --> 01:50:01,920
-We have a history.
-It was just a kiss.

1787
01:50:02,089 --> 01:50:03,886
Day nothing.

1788
01:50:04,491 --> 01:50:05,617
I am gonna teII him.

1789
01:50:08,495 --> 01:50:10,122
Do me a favor...

1790
01:50:10,297 --> 01:50:12,527
...and sIeep on it.

1791
01:50:25,112 --> 01:50:27,103
Your first <i>sheesha</i> experience.

1792
01:50:27,647 --> 01:50:30,172
This is very exciting.

1793
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:33,080
You put this pipe in your mouth--

1794
01:50:33,253 --> 01:50:35,414
And suck?

1795
01:50:41,528 --> 01:50:43,359
You are a naturaI.

1796
01:50:57,277 --> 01:51:00,337
I think you have another audience.

1797
01:51:07,053 --> 01:51:09,783
Abu Dhabi is so cutting-edge
in so many ways...

1798
01:51:09,956 --> 01:51:12,220
...and so backward when it comes to sex.

1799
01:51:12,392 --> 01:51:14,451
And the paradox is...

1800
01:51:14,628 --> 01:51:19,224
...I find myseIf to be most aroused
on my trips here.

1801
01:51:19,399 --> 01:51:21,128
Do teII.

1802
01:51:23,003 --> 01:51:28,134
If we were in. say. Paris.
or Madrid. right now...

1803
01:51:32,279 --> 01:51:36,477
...I wouId be having my hand down
your bIouse. brushing your nippIes.

1804
01:51:37,818 --> 01:51:41,219
But here. such things are forbidden.

1805
01:51:41,588 --> 01:51:44,682
And it's Iike being a boy again.

1806
01:51:48,528 --> 01:51:49,995

1
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:47,047
Leave me alone, will ya?
You think you're so smart.

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,049
Would you stay still already?

3
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,051
What a geek!

4
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,053
- I'm not a geek!
- You're doing it wrong!

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,055
- Shut up!
- You're doing it wrong.

6
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,140
- It doesn't go like that.
- Who asked you?

7
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,185
- Who's your brother?
- You are, Stevie!

8
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,813
You do it like this,
it'll open up in a fire,

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,024
you'll get burned and die.

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,237
Let's go!

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,739
What d'you got, Adcox, a big deal?

12
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,741
Medium deal, Captain.

13
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,202
Hey, Brian, want to come along?

14
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,080
- Dad...
- Stephen, you've come a dozen times.

15
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,624
Give your brother a chance.
What d'you say?

16
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,751
We'll be back in a minute.
How about it?

17
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,628
- Sure!
- Come on!

18
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,392
- Pull the cord, Brian!

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,769
1545 Idylwild.

20
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,620
- Give it a yank, a good pull.

21
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,206
You've gotta get
these cars outta the way.

22
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,625
- Give it another yank!

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,354
Well, there it is,
right over there. See it?

24
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,327
Okay.

25
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,329
You stay
near the truck now.

26
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,290
That doesn't look too bad.

27
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,751
Drop two lines
and hold the squad.

28
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,795
Everything I own in the
whole world is up there.

29
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,548
All my stuff's up there!

30
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,767
Adcox! Ladder up!

31
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,853
Hey, that's your
old man up there, Brian.

32
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,336
Nice grab, Captain!

33
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,175
Take it easy.
You'll be okay.

34
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,105
We got it!
Come on.

35
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,754
Dad!

36
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,965
Hold on, Adcox.
Is that a gas line?

37
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,593
- Dad!

38
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,818
Hey, Brian!
Brian McCaffrey, got some I.D.?

39
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,696
Hey, Willie!
I'll give you I.D.!

40
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,740
- The littlest McCaffrey!
- How you doin'?

41
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,076
Hot off the presses, boys!
Station assignments!

42
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,120
Hey, McCaffrey!
Station assignments!

43
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,289
Why don't you hold onto
that for me, huh?

44
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,042
Something wrong
with my eyesight?

45
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,044
You really trying
this fireman thing again?

46
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,797
- Quitting once wasn't good enough?
- It's in the blood.

47
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,799
- Is that right?
- Willie, you owe me a brew!

48
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,885
Hold on!
I'm talking to the fire chief!

49
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,346
Let's look and see
what else was in your blood.

50
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
I always looked forward
to getting these.

51
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,810
- You hold onto those, huh?
- Whoa! I got station 17!

52
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:38,524
"Aspen Snowmobile Tours.
Brian McCaffrey, Sales. "

53
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,859
It didn't offer the growth
and challenge that I needed.

54
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,863
"Cattle Drive Mobile Log Cabins. "

55
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,574
- That was in your blood six months?
- The coffee sucked.

56
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:51,537
"Brian's Sound Spectrum,
Direct Hi-end Stereo Sales. "

57
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,664
This is your own company.
This was a big step, huh?

58
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,168
I was ahead of my time, Willie.

59
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,628
McCaffrey!

60
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,673
What's the matter with you?
Aren't you even curious?

61
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,553
Engine 115, right?

62
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,769
How'd you know, you prick?
These are supposed to be sealed.

63
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,063
Lucky guess.

64
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,276
And a case of Scotch to the captain
at station assignments.

65
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,278
You crooked son-of-a-bitch!

66
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,995
Make us proud, guys!

67
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,997
McCaffrey, that's
my cousin's company.

68
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,999
Come on!

69
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,967
Calm down, Mrs. Vaitkus.

70
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,307
Mrs. Vaitkus, please, calm down.

71
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,145
McCaffrey, I think it's a box,
or a 211, at least.

72
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,690
- Just give me one minute.
- Hurry, we can't miss this one!

73
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,861
- Hey.
- Hi, Jen.

74
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,406
- I see your grandma's still-
- Yeah, she still hates you.

75
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,455
- You look great.
- Thanks. How long you been in town?

76
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,540
Four months.

77
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,959
- Oh, really.
- But I, uh...

78
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,336
I've been really busy
at the academy.

79
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,797
I graduated today.

80
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,882
I can see that.

81
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,051
So what have you been up to?

82
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,805
Well, uh...
I work at city hall, actually.

83
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,433
No kidding? That's great!

84
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,728
So...
I don't know what-

85
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,903
Maybe you and I could...
could get together for a beer.

86
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,072
A beer?

87
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,159
Beer... that's-

88
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,580
It's funny. You're acting
like I just saw you last week.

89
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,374
When I haven't seen you
in what... six years?

90
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,920
You son-of-a-bitch!

91
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,006
Don't want ya overheatin', Brian!

92
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,341
I'll give you overheatin'!

93
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,559
Easy, man. I don't have
time for this bullshit.

94
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,478
Well, you've certainly matured.

95
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,068
Well, it's nice to know
we can still be friends.

96
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,825
Come on, Brian.
We got a fire to go to.

97
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,746
Engine 17,
your pressure's fine.

98
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,748
Get out of the way here,
please.

99
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,083
Officers, you're standing around
with your thumb up your asses.

100
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,085
- Where you going?
- I'm a fireman.

101
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,504
Go!

102
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,050
Need a second lead-out?

103
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,052
What the fuck are you
talking about?

104
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,720
- Get out of here!
- Brian!

105
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,308
This is the
real shit, man!

106
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,310
The real thing!

107
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,696
Well, what do we got here?

108
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,698
A fireman's costume, huh?

109
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,492
Where'd you rent it?

110
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,662
Thanks for coming to
my graduation today, brother.

111
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,664
You're a real
inspiration to me.

112
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:49,001
I'm sorry, man.

113
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:53,505
You're really ready to fight
fire this time, huh, Brian?

114
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,385
It just doesn't work on you,
little brother.

115
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,346
- I'll see you around.
- Not likely.

116
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:05,058
You see, that's where
you're wrong already.

117
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,686
I talked to
Chief Fitzgerald.

118
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,064
He decided maybe you shouldn't be
way on the other side of town...

119
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,066
where I'd never
get to see you.

120
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,068
Starting tomorrow,
you're going to be...

121
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,071
with the toughest company
in the city.

122
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,616
17... my company.

123
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,412
One case of Scotch, Brian?

124
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,956
Man, you're gettin' cheap
in your old age.

125
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,335
Get outta here, girls.

126
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:36,057
You should learn not to box
when the 17's on the job.

127
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,789
Hey, Inspector Rimgale,
she's all yours.

128
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,599
Hey, give me a shot
of that, will ya?

129
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,828
Hey, Shadow.

130
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,205
So, you got a cause there?

131
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,168
Mice with matches.

132
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,298
Well, the glory boys
are going to have to...

133
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,301
wait a few days on this one.

134
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,727
Sean?

135
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,978
Sean!

136
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,941
Hey, buddy.
What's goin' on?

137
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,863
It's Uncle Brian.

138
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,200
You'll remember this.

139
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,202
Spinach?

140
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,705
We don't need no
stinkin' spinach!

141
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,499
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey...

142
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,709
Hey, what's-

143
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,544
Come here. It's okay.

144
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,380
- Hello?
- Yeah?

145
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,843
- Brian...
- Hey, Helen.

146
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,095
God, I'd about
written you off.

147
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,598
I know, well-

148
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,600
So, uh...
What's goin' on?

149
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,602
- Can I come in for a second?
- Sure.

150
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,563
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

151
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,565
Good to see you.

152
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,902
So that's Sean, huh?

153
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,820
Geez, he's a little giant now.

154
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:08,200
You'd be surprised
what a few years can do to a kid.

155
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,286
- Remember your Uncle Brian?
- No.

156
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,747
You don't remember him?

157
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,918
Hey, Sean-man.
Where's your daddy today?

158
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,259
Uh... Stephen's not
staying here anymore.

159
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,471
He moved out last April.

160
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,396
I'm sorry, Helen, I, uh-

161
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,775
You guys should try picking up
the phone once in a while.

162
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,790
Hey!

163
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,461
Hey.

164
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,549
I, uh...
talked to Helen.

165
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,097
I thought Dad's boat
was finally retired...

166
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,099
to the old family graveyard.

167
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,146
Don't you worry about
falling out of this thing?

168
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,734
I've gotta tell you,

169
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,361
I love what you've
done with the place.

170
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,614
Yeah, it's comin' along.

171
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,621
You want a beer?

172
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,915
Yeah, why not?

173
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,335
What, you been rippin' off
fire stations again?

174
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,337
Just some old stuff...

175
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,964
that Adcox gave me that
the department was gonna throw out.

176
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,467
But it's good enough
for this tub.

177
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,177
What is this?

178
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,055
"Iron Butterfly,"
"Cream"?

179
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,891
You gotta be kidding! This isn't
an actual operating 8-track!

180
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,893
What do you want, Brian?

181
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,229
What are you doin' here?

182
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,902
I wanna know why you messed
with my station assignment.

183
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,279
I mean, does this
really have to be...

184
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,782
one of those big brother,
little brother...

185
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,368
you broke my G.I. Joe and
I'm still pissed games?

186
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,537
Man, how do you do it, huh?

187
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,622
How d'you keep
coming up with...

188
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,666
new and amazing ways
to fuck up?

189
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,668
I mean, that Scotch bullshit?

190
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,046
Am I really supposed
to believe you came home...

191
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,340
because you felt heartstrings
moan for the family biz?

192
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,342
You were bankrupt!
The scary thing is...

193
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,846
you probably coulda
got away with it for awhile.

194
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,848
Hang back a little bit
at the fires-

195
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,933
You know the drill.

196
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,061
The only problem is,
that in this job...

197
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,063
there's just no place to hide.

198
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,066
It's not like having
a bad day selling log cabins.

199
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,819
You have a bad day here,
somebody dies.

200
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,114
And that's just not
fucking good enough.

201
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,119
You know something?

202
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,121
I must've told myself
a million times...

203
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,373
I didn't even want
to be a damn fireman.

204
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,042
Look, I know I quit
the academy before.

205
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,254
- And I know how you must've felt.
- Oh, you do?

206
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,256
You know how I felt?

207
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,758
I gotta do this, Stephen.

208
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,804
I need to know.

209
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:19,725
Yeah, I think you're
going to find out, Brian.

210
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,647
Try not to be late
tomorrow, huh?

211
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:50,005
Give me a break, huh!

212
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,761
Shit!

213
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,763
Come on, damn it!

214
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,779
Oh, shit!

215
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,533
- My car wouldn't start!
- What are you doin', man?

216
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,871
Atta boy!

217
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,500
Damn!

218
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,340
Come on, man.
You can make it!

219
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,561
Well, Baby McCaffrey,
how you doin'?

220
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,479
How you doin', John?

221
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,360
Hey, Axe,
you know this rug rat?

222
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,571
Know him?
I practically raised him.

223
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:58,782
He never calls.
He never writes.

224
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,826
I'm Brian.

225
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,412
I'm sorry.

226
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,054
All right!
Garment factory.

227
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:25,058
Shake and bake, boys!
I think we got a barbecue.

228
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,979
Got yourself a hot one
first time out, kid.

229
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,706
Oh, yeah, this is
gonna taste like shit.

230
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,250
- All right, let's go!
- Shit!

231
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:57,633
I hate it when we gotta
fucking go look for it.

232
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,636
Call in a box, Otis.
We're gonna need some back-up.

233
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,013
Brian, inch-and-a-half.

234
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,641
Get the high-rise jet.

235
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,611
- These moments do try me.
- Be gentle now, Axe.

236
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,533
Holy shit!

237
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,040
Coming through!

238
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,340
Hey, Probie,
how about it, huh?

239
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,390
- You ready?
- Yeah.

240
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,310
You're doin' it wrong.

241
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,482
Stay beside me.
I mean, right beside me.

242
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,360
Come on, man.
Kick it in.

243
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,112
Get down!

244
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,368
Show time!

245
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,175
Got it!

246
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:44,907
- Let's take it from the side.
- No, let's hit it head-on!

247
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,577
It's gonna flash on us, Bull.
We gotta back out!

248
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,079
She'll steam on us a little,
but she won't flash.

249
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:53,582
Here comes your water.

250
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,755
Here it comes!

251
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,436
All right,
let's go for the throat!

252
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,454
Hey, Nightengale!
Save your fucking air, man.

253
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:35,249
Pull down that wall!

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,044
I gotta ventilate this heat.

255
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:56,311
All right, hook us up to a standpipe!
Come on, Brian, hustle!

256
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,615
Shit!

257
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,667
It's in the walls!

258
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:27,843
- How about it, Probie?
- Coming!

259
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,764
Come on, Brian.
We're going to lose this!

260
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,600
Shit!

261
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,145
Charge it!

262
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,779
- Hey, Otis, is it-
- It's jumpin' floors.

263
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,781
So where's the second-in
companies, huh?

264
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,284
Sorry, man, John Wayne time.
You're on your own, boss.

265
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,204
- No back-up.
- Shit!

266
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,748
Dig in.

267
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,419
- Dig in, goddamn it!
- All right, come on!

268
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:06,173
What the hell's goin' on?
What was that, goddamn it?

269
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,675
Slow down,
it's jumpin' floors to us.

270
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,386
Relax, put your mask on.
It's gonna be the real deal.

271
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,900
Down!

272
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,861
Cover up, Lieutenant!

273
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,285
Jesus Christ!

274
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,875
I'm burning up!

275
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,920
Put him out!

276
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:46,588
Bull!

277
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,385
All right, go get it!

278
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:55,055
Hey!

279
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:57,933
Sorry, kid.
I thought you were dead.

280
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,271
We got it. Let's go!

281
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,943
Oh, shit!

282
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,946
Man down!

283
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,329
Look out!

284
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm going!

285
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,388
You go, we go!

286
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,975
Come on!

287
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,898
Pull!

288
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,402
Brian, let's go!

289
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,657
Hey, Stephen!

290
00:26:55,741 --> 00:27:00,329
The chief thinks we got one left
behind downstairs, a civilian.

291
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,122
Axe!

292
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,626
Take-

293
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,836
Down to two probies, perfect!

294
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,423
- Take Tim and do a search!
- Let's go, kid!

295
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:14,510
- Stay with him.
- Okay, I will.

296
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:17,221
Come on. Let's move it, Brian.
Stay on this line.

297
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,686
Ow! You son-of-a-bitch!

298
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,981
More line!

299
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,119
Shit!

300
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,872
Help!

301
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:47,084
Stephen! Over here!

302
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,460
Someone's over here!

303
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:51,213
Help!

304
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:03,976
- Where's my brother?
- I don't know. I ain't seen him, Bull!

305
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,649
Is anybody in here?

306
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,851
My God!

307
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:50,022
I got one!

308
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,195
I got one!

309
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:59,114
Somebody, give me a hand!

310
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,124
Is she going to be
all right?

311
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,711
I'm afraid you're a little
too late with this one.

312
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,062
Sorry to hear about the mannequin.

313
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,315
I heard you two were close.

314
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,838
You all right?

315
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:58,131
You didn't get burned,
did you?

316
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:01,426
Look, I'm a little
busy right now.

317
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,352
You've got an awful short memory
for direct orders.

318
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,355
- I told you to stay beside me.
- I heard somebody call.

319
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,399
What was that bullshit
with the standpipe?

320
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,733
The cap was stuck!

321
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:19,862
I told you to stay right
be-fucking-side me, Brian!

322
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:23,532
Hey, look, I was doing it!

323
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:26,160
I was up there doing it!

324
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,370
You don't know, man.
You don't know what I did!

325
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:32,875
What you did was
drop the ball, Probie.

326
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:37,171
You split the team up.
Get that part right...

327
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:42,718
if you wanna.

328
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,657
- Let me get one of those.
- Here you go.

329
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:10,621
I don't know, Axe.
I don't know.

330
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:13,081
That Stephen, man.

331
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,959
What goes through
that guy's head?

332
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,128
Never wears his mask.

333
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:21,465
Making us take it on
in the first room like that.

334
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,968
This shit's happening
too often, man.

335
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:28,472
- Could've flashed. Should've flashed!
- Yeah, but it didn't.

336
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:32,851
- Stevie knows.
- The guy's lucky.

337
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,026
- Alderman.
- Inspector Rimgale.

338
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,821
- I... need to get in that trunk.
- Oh, excuse me.

339
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:45,864
Thanks.

340
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:52,412
Pretty fancy shoes you're
wearing for a fire scene.

341
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,957
Guess you haven't been
to many fires.

342
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,459
We wanted to talk to you
about Alan Seagrave's death.

343
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,837
We still haven't gotten
a fire report.

344
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,631
You'll get that answer
as soon as I do, ma'am.

345
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:05,634
A man gets stuffed through
the windshield of his own car.

346
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,636
Is that an accident or arson?

347
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:11,807
People are asking me.
I gotta tell 'em something.

348
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,852
We're starting to get the feeling
your office is dragging out this case...

349
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,814
to embarrass the Alderman because
of his fire department cutbacks.

350
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:22,985
I have an uncomplicated job:
to decide if a fire is arson.

351
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,487
If so, to catch
the son-of-a-bitch doing it.

352
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:28,073
If my investigative methods
happen to muck up...

353
00:32:28,157 --> 00:32:31,076
the campaign of
certain mayor wannabes,

354
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,245
I gotta tell you,

355
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:35,914
I'm not going to lose
any sleep over it.

356
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:39,376
I'm sure you're gonna have that report
on my desk as soon as it's ready.

357
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,753
- You'll have it.
- Thank you.

358
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:47,092
That guy better not make any rights
on reds in my district.

359
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:50,179
Hey, Swayzak?

360
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:53,557
You missed it.

361
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,310
Get over there.
Keep 'em busy.

362
00:32:56,351 --> 00:33:00,564
You should've been there.
It was fucking great!

363
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,026
We almost lost a whole
goddamn company for you.

364
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:08,322
Since you shut down 33,
there's no fucking backup.

365
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,449
We appreciate it.
I don't know about the rest,

366
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:14,495
- but you got my vote for mayor.
- If you have a problem, help us.

367
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:17,039
- Work with the task force.
- The task force?

368
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:20,834
Three guys have died because of cuts
made by your fucking task force!

369
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:25,464
Know that little glow that's starting
to blink in the corner of your eye?

370
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:28,300
That's your career dissipation light.
It went into overtime.

371
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,469
- Come on, man.
- No.

372
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:33,722
If anybody's lights
are about to go out,

373
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:36,099
believe me, they're yours.

374
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,062
Thanks a lot, fellas.

375
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:42,606
You did a great job today,
by the way.

376
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,484
Alderman, will this affect
your task force findings?

377
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:48,320
No more today.
Good-bye.

378
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,406
So this is that big city job
you were talking about.

379
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,868
Yeah. Welcome home, Brian.

380
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,166
Where's that fucking guy
buy his shoes?

381
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,086
Did you check those out?
They're like fucking butter.

382
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,255
Hey, G-man!

383
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,257
Get outta here.

384
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:19,017
Do you have to do that?

385
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:22,729
Yeah. Could you
believe that fire?

386
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:26,275
There we were,
Adcox and me...

387
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:30,404
pulling that lady right out
of the fire's fucking throat.

388
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,282
We saved a life, man!

389
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,078
I love it here!
Fighting 17th!

390
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,205
Goddamn!

391
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,291
Stephen's amazing.

392
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:45,669
You see how he took that fire?
By the balls!

393
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,922
I'm gonna be
that good someday.

394
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:52,176
You watch.
You'll see.

395
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:56,180
You know what Stephen said to me?

396
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,765
When the shit
was coming hard,

397
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,894
he said,
"You never know...

398
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,980
till the moment
the fire stares you down...

399
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:08,775
- if you're just gonna do this job-"
- Or be great at it, right?

400
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:12,362
He using that line of shit
on you now?

401
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:15,657
You think he made
that little gem up?

402
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:19,828
My old man used to use
that line every other day.

403
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,956
It's no line, man!

404
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,417
That's no line.

405
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,172
Hey, kid,
we ain't waitin'!

406
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,509
Go, go, go!

407
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:38,222
Let's go!
No, no, not that way!

408
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,224
What's going on?

409
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,226
Come on. Let's go!

410
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:45,270
It's lunch, Probies!
Let's get started!

411
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:49,107
Ooo, caw, caw!
A couple of crows, man!

412
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,444
That money will probably
end up coming from-

413
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:56,323
- This better be good.
- Or we feed you to the thing.

414
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:03,121
Shut up. You got something
against Dalmatians?

415
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,123
Accident or murder?

416
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,626
That's the question arson investigators
are struggling with...

417
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:11,380
after a freak explosion known
by firefighters as a backdraft-

418
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:15,133
Hey, Pengelly, you're on TV.

419
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:18,470
- I saw you too!
- Look, that's me.

420
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:23,183
He's been identified as Alan
Seagrave, a prominent Chicago C.P.A.

421
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:26,311
Despite pressure
from the city council,

422
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,897
fire officials refuse
to speculate on the cause,

423
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,400
saying only that
their investigation is continuing.

424
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,945
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- Here he goes again.

425
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,030
As 17th's official toastmaster-

426
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:40,659
- And bullshitter.
- Thank you, Santos.

427
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:43,078
Did I mention you were
cut out of my will?

428
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,164
I think it appropriate...

429
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:49,418
that we recognize the two asswipes...
probationary firemen,

430
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:53,172
among us today,
who were officially baptized...

431
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:55,465
into the world of old man fire.

432
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:57,926
First, to Tim.

433
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,513
Despite the fact he was born
with a dull expression...

434
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:04,892
and a really hideous
pair of ears,

435
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,269
he not only took on the beast,

436
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,271
but pulled from its clutches,

437
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:12,983
assisted by a more famous and
brilliant firefighter... me,

438
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,069
a kicking and
screaming civilian...

439
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,114
who'll probably wind up suing us
for breaking her fingernails.

440
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,450
And to Brian.

441
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,161
Help me, Santos.

442
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:34,296
Whose own contribution...

443
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,924
was both more beautiful
and less likely to sue us.

444
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,051
Son-of-a-bitch.

445
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,803
When I heard that both
McCaffrey brothers...

446
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:46,683
were being assigned here
at this station at the same time,

447
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:50,771
my heart was filled with a...
sudden desire to transfer.

448
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,816
So raise a glass, lads,

449
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:58,779
to funny-looking Tim
and the McCaffrey brothers.

450
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,823
For despite the fact...

451
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:03,450
they've gotten on each
other's nerves for years,

452
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:06,870
have managed with great effort to still
be pissed off at each other.

453
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,498
Gentlemen...

454
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,959
Fuck you!

455
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,742
Thanks for the ride.

456
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:51,331
Hey, Brian.

457
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,378
I'll see you tonight, huh?

458
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,967
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

459
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,933
I've known Jack Fitzgerald
since he was a candidate.

460
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,060
They had fire engines then?

461
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:16,773
- Get that man's name!
- I gotta say, he was just as ugly then.

462
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:21,111
Can I have a beer, please?

463
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:24,281
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hey.

464
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:28,452
- ... home of the real firemen.

465
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,913
Enough of us stroking each other.

466
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,499
Here's the man
we're here to honor,

467
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:37,294
- Chief Jack Fitzgerald.

468
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:41,381
I know I speak
for everybody here.

469
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,301
It's about time you retired...

470
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,929
and made a promotion
for somebody else.

471
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,015
Think I oughta change the view.

472
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:53,060
I couldn't have
wished for a better life.

473
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,604
Thank you much.

474
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:09,535
- I don't believe this shit!
- Pretty boy, get a load of this.

475
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,412
Bull, wait'll
you listen to this shit.

476
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,581
- Let me see.
- Hey-hey-hey.

477
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:17,793
"Probationary Fireman,
Brian McCaffrey,

478
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:21,213
on his first fire, showed the bravery
and courage of a veteran...

479
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:24,424
when he risked life and limb to...

480
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:28,053
- double-check a burning floor, alone.

481
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:30,514
Emerging victoriously
with Anna Rodriquez,

482
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,184
a seamstress for the
North Shore Clothing Company. "

483
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:37,479
Axe, get a load
of this shit!

484
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:40,399
"McCaffrey first gained
prominence as the subject...

485
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:42,860
of a 1972 Pulitzer
Prize-winning photograph taken...

486
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,487
- at the scene of his father's death. "
- That's me.

487
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:47,656
What are we gonna do
about this?

488
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,741
- Hey, 17, what's going on?
- Well...

489
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:53,162
I think that
it's union bylaw...

490
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:56,582
that if you get your picture in
the paper, even if it's bullshit,

491
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:59,501
- you buy the whole company a drink.
- All right!

492
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:03,380
I know I'm gonna have
another double... on the hero!

493
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:06,216
- Give him a hand over here.
- What's this?

494
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,677
Leave 'em alone.

495
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,013
Good job.

496
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,232
Brian McCaffrey, huh?

497
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:26,862
Brian, this is my boss,
Alderman Swayzak. He wanted to meet you.

498
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,448
You should be proud of helping
to save that woman's life.

499
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:32,493
- That was a hell of a job.
- Don't believe everything you read.

500
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:35,829
Don't be so modest, Brian.

501
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,373
See that?

502
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:41,043
That's a mannequin.

503
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,680
Look, Brian,

504
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:57,100
let me just get down
to it, okay?

505
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,729
I've been checking you out.
Jennifer can't say enough.

506
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,484
I need your help.

507
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,862
- I'm gonna offer you a job.
- I've already got a job.

508
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:12,074
The great thing about this job,
it's still with the fire department.

509
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:15,744
One of your best investigators, Don
Rimgale, is working a really tough case.

510
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:18,247
He needs an extra pair of hands.

511
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,958
If that name is gonna
come from my office,

512
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,252
- I want it to be you.
- Why is that?

513
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:27,673
I want someone from a real traditional
fire-fighting clan.

514
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:31,260
Yeah, we got
all kinds of traditions...

515
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:34,221
like dying young.
Thanks anyway.

516
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:44,898
Took you all of 30 seconds
to blow that off.

517
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,111
Brian, I know it's not
my place to say this,

518
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:52,990
but I think you're passing
on a great opportunity.

519
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:56,743
- You're smarter than that.
- Look, Jen.

520
00:42:56,785 --> 00:43:01,123
I'm trying to do something here.
Can't you see that?

521
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,458
I'm trying to be a fireman,

522
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,128
not some kind of poster boy
for Swayzak.

523
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,339
There's gotta be at least
500 other smoke eaters here...

524
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:12,259
that do that shit
for real every day.

525
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:15,512
Why don't you tell Swayzak
to talk to one of them?

526
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:07,689
Hey, Bull, slow down.

527
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,577
Helen, can I talk
to you for a minute?

528
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,789
- What about?
- It's about Sean.

529
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:27,167
Right here, right now,
you wanna talk about Sean?

530
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,795
- How you doin', Stephen?
- Hey, Jackson.

531
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:33,173
You don't have
to stop dancing.

532
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:36,218
It's only our son,
for Christ's sake.

533
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,304
- Stephen, you don't have to remind me.
- Stephen.

534
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:43,976
- What about your dumbass brother?
- Wait a second.

535
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,480
Saving a mannequin.
How fuckin' stupid can a guy get?

536
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:51,650
- Stephen, relax.
- Let go.

537
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:55,946
Stephen!

538
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:59,491
You got anything else you want
to say about my brother?

539
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,994
Goddamn you, McCaffrey!

540
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:10,586
Atta boy, Brian!

541
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,799
Take it outside!

542
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:19,720
- Knock it off!
- Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

543
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,933
Ow-ow-ow.
Oh, I'm bleeding.

544
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,314
Jesus!

545
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,941
Knock it off.
Come on, eh?

546
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,110
Hey! Knock it off.

547
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:38,113
Hey, hey, I'm fine.

548
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,741
Jesus, Stevie, you never
know when to quit, do you?

549
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:42,826
Do you ever wonder why...

550
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,788
you're stuck a fucking lieutenant
for life?

551
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:49,124
No.

552
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:58,300
Come on.
Let's get a drink.

553
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,636
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

554
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,596
Hey, whoa!

555
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:07,476
- Get him outta here!
- I just wanna get a drink.

556
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,188
You need to get the hell
outta here. Let's go.

557
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,732
The whole family's crazy.

558
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:16,318
You nailed him.

559
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,403
He's all right.
He said something.

560
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:21,114
- What'd he say?
- I don't remember.

561
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:23,200
Listen, I can walk by myself.

562
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:26,078
Ow! I hurt my ankle, man.

563
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:29,498
Don't stand and laugh.
Get me up!

564
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,418
Yeah. Oop. Photographer.

565
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:36,922
-Think I can get on the cover of "Life"?
-Let's go.

566
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,508
- Is Axe a great guy?

567
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,678
He doesn't know shit
about what I want.

568
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:45,430
I've got news for everybody.
I'm not my old man.

569
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:50,352
A fire won't get me.
I know more than he did.

570
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:53,397
I know more about fire
than all of 'em.

571
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,692
Time for bed, Sugar Ray.

572
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,777
Let me get those for you.

573
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:01,155
Get outta my way.
I can get my shoes off.

574
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:04,158
You're such
a pain in the ass.

575
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,493
You always were.

576
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:10,497
What are you talkin' about?
I saved your ass tonight.

577
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:18,130
Why don't they trust me
anymore, huh, Brian?

578
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:23,135
Really, the guys just
don't trust me anymore.

579
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:37,232
Hey, this boat could
be great, don't you think?

580
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,904
Maybe I'll just...

581
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:48,577
just take it out
on weekends.

582
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:53,415
Sean and me.

583
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,542
We could just float.

584
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:42,297
Get it on your shoulder,
Probie. It's not a football.

585
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:59,958
You're not breaking
any records, Brian.

586
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:03,629
Goddamn it!
Get it on your shoulder!

587
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:07,966
All right, Stephen.
Come on, Stephen!

588
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,596
Come on, Brian.
Kick that old man's ass!

589
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:19,436
Run, damn you!

590
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:25,234
I'm comin'. I'm comin'!

591
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,349
Aw, shit!

592
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,268
Are you okay?

593
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,353
Yeah.

594
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:09,278
Run, damn you!

595
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:15,826
Oh, shit.
Okay, roll the hose.

596
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:21,373
- Are you kidding me? By myself?
- You heard me.

597
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:26,253
- What about Tim?
- Aw, shit. What about Tim?

598
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,672
For Christ's sake.
Next time I'll let you win.

599
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:34,386
You got a problem
with drilling, Probie?

600
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:38,473
- Is that it?
- No! I don't have a problem with it.

601
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:42,060
But let's just have
one drill, Lieutenant,

602
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:46,690
-not one for the company and one for me.
-Roll the hose now!

603
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:49,943
I'm not gonna quit, Stephen.
You hear me?

604
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,281
I'm not gonna quit.

605
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,621
My baby!
My baby is still up there!

606
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:03,165
- Please, somebody!
- Where's your baby at?

607
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:05,876
How many men
you got in there?

608
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,378
My baby is still up there.
Please help me!

609
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:11,006
Hold on, Steve.
Don't go up there.

610
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:14,343
- Wait for the hose line.
- Brian!

611
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,979
Hey, don't take that kind
of shit from it!

612
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:29,274
Don't let it know
you're scared!

613
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:35,823
-Stephen, we gotta wait for a hose team.
-No time.

614
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:45,707
Come on!

615
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:02,558
- You ready?
- We gotta wait for a hose team.

616
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:05,477
Jump when I say.
It won't get us.

617
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:08,230
Now! Hold your breath!

618
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:31,086
Stephen!

619
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:27,100
- Steve, Steve.
- All right.

620
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,770
- You kicked ass, Bull.
- Way to go, Bull.

621
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:31,855
Thanks.

622
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:38,070
Man, that was
pretty crazy, huh?

623
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:43,200
I waited.
I would've waited.

624
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:48,283
- Come on. Don't worry about it.
- But you did it, man.

625
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:53,126
You did it all the way.
You were really a hero.

626
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:59,591
Brian...
it's not about being a hero.

627
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:03,637
I went in because
there was a kid up there.

628
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,267
I do what I do because that's my way.
And it was Dad's way.

629
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,895
- Maybe it's not everybody's way.
- Dad's way?

630
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:15,023
He tell you that in
a fucking séance, huh?

631
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,651
You said you needed
to know something.

632
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:20,863
What did you learn today, huh?

633
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,575
What if there had been
another kid up there?

634
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,538
Oh, I don't know.

635
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:33,208
What do you think, Brian?

636
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,919
Time to move on?

637
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:47,347
You're right.

638
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:52,060
You win, Stephen.
You're the best.

639
00:55:57,483 --> 00:55:59,610
Hey, Brian?

640
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:10,954
Brian.

641
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:13,457
Hi.

642
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:17,252
Listen, Jen, I-

643
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:20,756
I've been thinking
about what you said.

644
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:23,926
If the offer's still on the table,
I'd like to talk about it.

645
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,473
Well, great!

646
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:32,351
That's great,
really great news.

647
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:36,355
The alderman will be thrilled
that you're working with us.

648
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,484
Marty's a good man, Brian.

649
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:44,738
Yeah.

650
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,724
So stop me if I got this wrong.

651
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,936
The fire's almost out, you're upstairs
on the unburned floor...

652
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,272
- checkin' for heat. Correct?
- Yes, sir.

653
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:20,732
- Messages for you.
- Thank you.

654
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:22,776
You've been told by your
battalion chief, your captain...

655
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,529
and by me not to
do nothin', right?

656
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,781
- Do nothin' until ordered, correct?
- Yes, sir.

657
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:30,993
Now the itch starts.
The glory boy flash starts.

658
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:32,995
"I'm a hero.
Heroes don't stand around. "

659
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,247
- You can tell me. That's what it was?
- Yes, sir.

660
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:38,458
So you punched out
a window for ventilation.

661
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,795
Was that before or after you noticed
you were standing in a lake of gasoline?

662
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:44,464
Was that before
or after you noticed...

663
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:47,551
you were standing in a lake
of gasoline, you idiot?

664
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:50,929
Before, sir.

665
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:54,183
You could have burned, killed,
or crispered half that company.

666
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:58,729
You wrecked the physical evidence that
I use to prove that it's arson.

667
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:02,816
You know how goddamn hard
it is to determine the cause.

668
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:05,986
Now go home and you
think about that.

669
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:11,283
- I'll have to call him back.
- Excuse me.

670
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:13,327
- Yeah?
- Brian McCaffrey, your new assistant.

671
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,663
Oh, Dennis' kid. Why don't you
go find a corner to hide in?

672
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:19,082
I'll get to you later.
I don't wanna deal with you now.

673
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:26,632
Great.

674
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:51,198
You still standing there?

675
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:56,703
I think we should get
something straight here now.

676
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:58,705
I was assigned to
this office by the city.

677
00:58:58,747 --> 00:59:01,041
- You better get used to me.
- I know who you were assigned by.

678
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,877
I knew your father too.
He was a hell of a fireman.

679
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:05,879
He had a hell of a reputation.

680
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:08,382
But it don't cut slack here
as far as I'm concerned.

681
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:11,760
Swayzak sends you here, fine.
I gotta eat you? Those are the rules.

682
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:13,804
I got nothin'
to say about that.

683
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:16,932
Swayzak or no,
you work for me now.

684
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:19,560
Step outta line, make one false move,
you're outta here.

685
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:23,397
Don't think
you're the first.

686
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:25,649
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?

687
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:26,900
Pest control.

688
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:37,411
Shadow, Shadow

689
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:38,996
Hi, Shadow.

690
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,498
Hi, Ronald. How ya doin'?
Stayin' comfortable?

691
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:46,086
- I didn't think you would make it.
- I wouldn't miss this.

692
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,422
- Who's that?
- He works for me.

693
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:50,716
Is he a fireman?
I like firemen.

694
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,718
You like everybody, Ronald.

695
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:57,264
Brian McCaffrey. Yeah, sure.
No, that's Stephen.

696
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,019
He's the little one
with the hat.

697
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,855
Oh, what a treat!

698
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:08,484
- Hey, do I know you?
- Your dad did.

699
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:12,279
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Nah, put it away.

700
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:15,616
Come on, Shadow. He lost
his dad to the animal and...

701
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:19,411
you didn't even tell him who
he was coming to see? Tell him.

702
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:23,624
Let me tell you about Ronald.
Ronald likes telephones.

703
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:26,126
Likes to tape wooden matches
to the bell strikers...

704
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,129
and then wrap it
in cotton with gasoline.

705
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:32,216
Had a whole little thing goin', huh?
And when you got bored?

706
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:34,218
What'd you do?

707
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:38,847
- He started makin' calls.
- Never proved.

708
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,183
Tell him about us
down on State Street.

709
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:45,354
Nah. Nobody cares
about that one.

710
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:49,274
It was your basic warehouse torch
I was doin' for the owner.

711
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:52,152
I mean, they were a cakewalk.
I just-

712
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:57,115
I just lost my concentration
and my animal turned on me.

713
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:59,326
Got the whole place
going like hell.

714
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:02,663
My hair was on fire, my hands.

715
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,998
Everything.
I was dead.

716
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:07,125
Then suddenly I was alive.
I was pulled out of there...

717
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:10,712
by my hero, my Shadow here.

718
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:13,924
Except, he didn't see this big tub
of phosphorous, did you?

719
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:18,345
Explosion lit him up so bright,
left his shadow on the wall.

720
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:21,807
Still shy about rolling up
your sleeves, Shadow?

721
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,851
Show him your stomach.

722
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:28,480
The funny thing
about firemen,

723
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:30,858
night and day,
they're always firemen.

724
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:34,444
Ronald Bartel.

725
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:37,990
All right, the parole board
has received...

726
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:40,367
Mr. Bartel's fitness report,

727
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:45,205
his I.D. 44,
endorsement from his section warden.

728
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:47,249
Dr. Norris?

729
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:49,626
As supervising psychiatrist,
I would describe...

730
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,254
Mr. Bartel's
progress as remarkable.

731
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:54,339
Taking into account
his disability and the six years...

732
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,593
he's already served,
I recommend a parole.

733
01:01:57,676 --> 01:02:00,053
Mr. Bartel,

734
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,556
do you regret your crimes?

735
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,810
Yes, and-

736
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:11,815
and I'm aware
of the pain that I have caused.

737
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:14,359
If released, will you
commit these crimes again?

738
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,403
No. No, I won't.

739
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:19,740
Do you consider yourself
ready for society?

740
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,742
Yes, I do.

741
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,996
Yeah, right, Ronald.
You're ready, all right.

742
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,665
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

743
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,877
- Shadow.
- Remember this?

744
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:34,087
Remember this, Ronald?

745
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:36,256
- Remember who it belonged to?
- Mm-hmm.

746
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:38,759
What did you do to
that little girl?

747
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,595
It's not fair, Shadow.

748
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:44,056
What did you do
to that little girl?

749
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,528
I burned her.

750
01:02:57,611 --> 01:02:59,613
You burned her.

751
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:04,201
What do you do to
old ladies, Ronald?

752
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:06,370
Burn them.

753
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:09,081
And what about the world, Ronald?

754
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:11,792
What would you like
to do with the whole world?

755
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:16,672
Burn it all.

756
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:28,225
See ya next year, Ronald.

757
01:04:05,025 --> 01:04:08,446
We figured the body's
the owner, some guy named Cosgrove.

758
01:04:08,529 --> 01:04:11,615
Weird blast, though,
like that other guy...

759
01:04:11,657 --> 01:04:13,784
who went through
the windshield of his own car.

760
01:04:13,868 --> 01:04:17,079
Explosion blew out the flame
before the engine got here.

761
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:20,875
Good for us;
not too good for him.

762
01:04:32,261 --> 01:04:34,555
Bring the toolbox.

763
01:04:40,394 --> 01:04:42,646
Tim, get the hot spots.

764
01:04:42,688 --> 01:04:46,484
You in the cheap seats,
watch it.

765
01:04:47,443 --> 01:04:48,944
There's Brian.

766
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:52,531
Well, let's go.

767
01:04:52,615 --> 01:04:55,993
Hey, McCaffrey,
need a special invitation? Come on.

768
01:04:57,703 --> 01:05:00,164
Charge the line, Axe.

769
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:06,212
- What do you want me to do with this?

770
01:05:06,295 --> 01:05:09,090
We got heavy smoke stains
observed in entry room.

771
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:11,550
Smoke demarcation line
is very low.

772
01:05:11,634 --> 01:05:15,054
Fire never got hot enough
here to cook the soot off.

773
01:05:17,556 --> 01:05:21,018
Come on, you sneaky
little son-of-a-bitch.

774
01:05:21,102 --> 01:05:24,605
Come on. Tell me
where you came from.

775
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:27,149
Point me where you started.

776
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,360
Come on.

777
01:05:33,697 --> 01:05:36,200
Burn indicators distended
toward northern wall.

778
01:05:36,283 --> 01:05:40,287
Less soot here, more heat.

779
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:42,540
Lack of discoloration
in shattered glass...

780
01:05:42,623 --> 01:05:45,167
indicates slow burn
before explosion.

781
01:05:48,129 --> 01:05:50,673
There's some little
dead rat critters here.

782
01:05:52,299 --> 01:05:56,846
Fire originated in this room.
Took its time.

783
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:58,848
Hung out.

784
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:03,144
The air ran out. It couldn't breathe.
It was snuffed.

785
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:05,855
But it wasn't dead.

786
01:06:05,938 --> 01:06:08,566
Must have been all that
trapped heat lying low,

787
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:11,861
waiting for some sucker
to give it one big gulp of air.

788
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:14,905
Another backdraft.

789
01:06:21,036 --> 01:06:25,916
This is our point of origin.
Let me have a crowbar.

790
01:06:30,254 --> 01:06:33,382
No sign of accelerants.

791
01:06:36,302 --> 01:06:40,097
Well, if it's arson,
somebody figured a new way to hide it.

792
01:06:42,975 --> 01:06:46,729
Okay, we got Alan Seagrave...

793
01:06:46,771 --> 01:06:50,399
and Donald Cosgrove.

794
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:52,401
Both deaths due
to close encounters...

795
01:06:52,443 --> 01:06:55,946
with stationary objects.

796
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:58,991
We have an office door for Cosgrove...

797
01:06:59,075 --> 01:07:01,285
and, oh, an '87 Porsche for Seagrave.

798
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:05,247
No nonrelevant traumas.

799
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:09,168
No significant
blood toxicology.

800
01:07:09,251 --> 01:07:13,422
Attitude of both trajectories
are consistent with explosion.

801
01:07:13,506 --> 01:07:16,717
They ran the residue you scraped
from both front doors.

802
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:19,720
It's a combination of plumber's putty
and rayophene gum.

803
01:07:19,804 --> 01:07:21,764
It burns almost completely
away when you light it.

804
01:07:21,806 --> 01:07:23,808
- So it was on both doors?
- Yeah.

805
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:27,395
Something else I want to show you.
You're gonna have to help me.

806
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:30,856
McCaffrey, why don't you
come over and help us?

807
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,484
No, I don't think so.
Not in my contract.

808
01:07:33,526 --> 01:07:35,820
I just rewrote your contract.

809
01:07:35,903 --> 01:07:38,322
Come on over and help us.

810
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,079
- Anyway, we're gonna have to lift him.
- Great.

811
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:48,791
Christ, he's not gonna sell
you insurance. Just lift him up.

812
01:07:51,127 --> 01:07:53,421
Hold on.

813
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:55,756
You see that patch
of shirt right there?

814
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,800
We wondered about
the discoloration.

815
01:07:57,842 --> 01:08:00,344
So I scraped a piece off
and ran a spectro on it.

816
01:08:00,428 --> 01:08:04,473
On a lucky shot,
they picked up traces of something.

817
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,517
What was it?

818
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,145
Ah, trychtichlorate.

819
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:11,522
Nobody around here
ever heard of it.

820
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:14,191
Yeah, trychtichlorate.
It eats magnesium.

821
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:16,610
It's an absorption catalyst
used in toxic waste accidents.

822
01:08:16,694 --> 01:08:19,363
It's rare. They stopped making it
a couple of years ago.

823
01:08:19,447 --> 01:08:22,908
We figured it got in his clothes
in a gas state from the fire.

824
01:08:22,992 --> 01:08:24,910
What was it doing
in the fire?

825
01:08:24,994 --> 01:08:27,621
That's your job. Okay!

826
01:08:32,752 --> 01:08:36,380
Stephen, what-
What are you doing here?

827
01:08:36,464 --> 01:08:39,008
Just fixin' my roof.

828
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:42,887
You've gotta stop just showing
up on the roof like this.

829
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:45,765
Look, I just- I wanted to,
I don't know, not exactly...

830
01:08:45,848 --> 01:08:47,892
apologize for the other night,
especially since...

831
01:08:47,975 --> 01:08:49,894
- I don't remember much.
- You remember.

832
01:08:49,977 --> 01:08:53,105
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to say,
I don't know, something.

833
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:56,567
The great communicator.

834
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:07,953
So what's going on, Stephen?

835
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:12,917
You only bang on the roof
when you got something on your mind.

836
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:15,336
How's Brian doing?

837
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:20,341
- He's out. He quit.
- He just up and quit for no reason?

838
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:23,135
I don't care what you heard, Helen,
I treated him better...

839
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:25,679
than any other probie I ever had.
All right?

840
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:27,848
He probably
hates my guts...

841
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:30,434
but at least he finally
took a look in the mirror.

842
01:09:30,518 --> 01:09:33,479
So once again, Stephen's right
and somebody else is wrong.

843
01:09:33,562 --> 01:09:35,481
You always gotta be right.

844
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:37,942
- That's such bullshit.
- Yeah? Why?

845
01:09:37,983 --> 01:09:41,153
Because I'm the first
to admit it when I'm wrong.

846
01:09:41,237 --> 01:09:43,155
Yeah?
How often does that happen?

847
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:45,282
In a fire? Never!

848
01:09:48,077 --> 01:09:50,621
He would have
bought it, Helen.

849
01:09:50,704 --> 01:09:54,250
I'm telling ya, maybe not today,
maybe not next year;

850
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:57,795
but it would have happened.
All right? He's my brother.

851
01:09:57,837 --> 01:09:59,797
I couldn't just-

852
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,466
You just couldn't
live with that.

853
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:09,724
McCaffrey.

854
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:14,979
Yeah?

855
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:19,024
Take the top off.

856
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:24,405
Holy shit!

857
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:27,491
That's it.
That's it.

858
01:10:27,533 --> 01:10:31,036
Son-of-a-bitch! This guy is different.
He don't love fire.

859
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,371
- Who?
- The killer.

860
01:10:32,455 --> 01:10:35,249
He used magnesium to make
it look like an accident.

861
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,084
I got it after
we went to see Ronald.

862
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:39,503
Torchers want to fry
the whole goddamn world.

863
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:43,007
But the fires that killed those guys
never burned up that much.

864
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:46,802
The trychtichlorate hid the magnesium
in the plug, but it burned slow.

865
01:10:46,844 --> 01:10:48,971
And he made
his burns backdrafts.

866
01:10:49,013 --> 01:10:52,641
- But he killed these guys.
- Could have killed everybody.

867
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:55,895
Backdraft blew out the flame.
That's it. That's the reason.

868
01:10:55,978 --> 01:11:00,107
- What reason?
- Why backdrafts.

869
01:11:00,191 --> 01:11:02,193
Whoever fried
Seagrave and Cosgrove...

870
01:11:02,234 --> 01:11:05,029
went to a hell of a lot of trouble
to make sure they died by fire.

871
01:11:05,071 --> 01:11:07,364
They also made sure that
the fire blew itself out.

872
01:11:07,406 --> 01:11:10,034
So that's why they used
the putty in the doors.

873
01:11:11,243 --> 01:11:13,204
What do we got?
A torch with a conscience?

874
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:17,249
No. We got a stone killer
trying to make a point.

875
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,543
You can make the call now.
It's arson, right?

876
01:11:19,585 --> 01:11:22,713
I'm not calling anyone yet.

877
01:11:22,797 --> 01:11:25,257
You can't rush this.
I've seen it too many times before.

878
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:28,010
I wanna make sure
this torch doesn't walk.

879
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:31,263
We're gonna wait.

880
01:11:36,018 --> 01:11:38,979
Well, well, Mr. McCaffrey.

881
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:41,941
- Welcome aboard.
- Nice boat you got here.

882
01:11:42,024 --> 01:11:44,068
What?
You mean mine?

883
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:48,239
Well, not yet. Glad to have
you as part of the team, Brian.

884
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,991
Let's get a picture with
Mr. McCaffrey and myself.

885
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:56,455
You look good.
Yeah, there you go.

886
01:11:56,539 --> 01:12:00,251
Thanks. Hi.

887
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:02,545
Yeah, have fun now.
Great night, isn't it?

888
01:12:02,586 --> 01:12:05,172
Who is that?

889
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:07,842
- Larry Dewaay.
- Come on. Larry, how are ya?

890
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,949
Hey.

891
01:12:32,032 --> 01:12:34,869
- Yeah.
- How's the job going?

892
01:12:36,954 --> 01:12:40,624
- Okay.
- Yeah?

893
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:44,128
- Is Rimgale getting any better?
- Rimgale's Rimgale.

894
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:48,132
-He's just doing his job.
-Doing his job? He hasn't done anything.

895
01:12:48,174 --> 01:12:50,634
At this rate, he won't declare
it's arson before he retires.

896
01:12:57,266 --> 01:13:01,312
Will you get me out of here?
Otherwise I'll have to go pick her up.

897
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:09,862
This is it, one of the oldest
fire stations in the city.

898
01:13:09,945 --> 01:13:12,073
What do you think?

899
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:14,075
- It's homey.

900
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:17,328
The guys are sleeping upstairs.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

901
01:13:17,369 --> 01:13:20,956
This is my office.
Impressive, huh?

902
01:13:20,998 --> 01:13:24,251
Yes, it's very nice.

903
01:13:24,335 --> 01:13:27,338
Lot of tradition locked up
in this old house.

904
01:13:27,379 --> 01:13:29,340
See those doors?

905
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:33,177
They lead to the hay loft when they used
to have the old horse-drawn engines.

906
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:36,722
Lot different then.

907
01:13:36,806 --> 01:13:39,266
But kind of the same,
you know?

908
01:13:44,897 --> 01:13:47,274
Do you miss it?

909
01:13:49,193 --> 01:13:51,195
You seem like you do.

910
01:13:53,155 --> 01:13:57,284
Well, when I came back,

911
01:13:57,368 --> 01:14:01,330
I, uh- I knew.

912
01:14:01,372 --> 01:14:03,999
I knew that I really
wanted to be a fireman.

913
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:07,044
Then why'd you quit?

914
01:14:08,587 --> 01:14:13,259
Well, I should have said
I wanted to be a good one.

915
01:14:21,892 --> 01:14:24,812
So show me
your fire truck.

916
01:14:51,464 --> 01:14:55,468
Mask up, lads.
Bring that sledge.

917
01:15:01,515 --> 01:15:03,017
Where is it?

918
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,853
I don't know. There's alarms
goin' off on three floors.

919
01:15:14,862 --> 01:15:17,615
This alarm system's been
screwing up since they built-

920
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:21,118
- 10? 29?
- Yeah.

921
01:15:33,047 --> 01:15:36,967
How do we know if the floor's
gonna be on fire?

922
01:15:37,051 --> 01:15:39,095
Well, when the doors open,

923
01:15:39,136 --> 01:15:41,180
if it's hot,

924
01:15:41,263 --> 01:15:43,974
- don't get out.

925
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,024
We're gonna start on this side.
I'll meet you down at the end.

926
01:15:57,655 --> 01:16:01,826
- All right, come on. Come on.
- High-rise gigs give me the creeps.

927
01:16:03,661 --> 01:16:06,330
Bull, we're early
on this one again...

928
01:16:06,414 --> 01:16:09,291
and it ain't even broke out yet.
We're one short with Brian gone.

929
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:12,294
- Wait for the next-in engines.
- Let's catch it before it breaks out.

930
01:16:14,713 --> 01:16:18,092
- You want to learn something?
- Yeah, I do.

931
01:16:18,175 --> 01:16:20,553
Axe, go with Pengelly.
Take the other side.

932
01:16:20,636 --> 01:16:24,473
-Don't split us up again. It ain't safe.
-I haven't got time for this.

933
01:16:24,515 --> 01:16:29,353
- Then let me take the lead.
- Do your job; they need a line.

934
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,441
Come on.
Come on, Axe.

935
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:48,914
Oh, you're so very sly;
but, so am I.

936
01:17:10,227 --> 01:17:12,980
She's hot and smoky...

937
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:15,107
but she's not rollin' yet.

938
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:30,539
- Shit!

939
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:35,961
Hello, 51.
You follow 17 in the truck.

940
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:40,091
11201 South Clark.
It's a cancel.

941
01:17:40,132 --> 01:17:42,760
11021 South Clark.

942
01:17:42,802 --> 01:17:47,765
- South Clark.
- What time is it, anyway?

943
01:18:04,698 --> 01:18:07,451
All right, take it.

944
01:18:12,957 --> 01:18:15,167
Wait, wait.
Make sure you check it first.

945
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:17,169
Oh, yeah.

946
01:18:37,773 --> 01:18:41,235
- Howdy, boys.
- Brian!

947
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:43,821
- Here we go. Now get that mask back on.
- Right.

948
01:18:43,863 --> 01:18:46,824
Clear!

949
01:18:46,866 --> 01:18:48,826
Stay here.

950
01:19:06,802 --> 01:19:08,929
Check that door for heat, Tim?

951
01:19:15,519 --> 01:19:17,438
Tim!

952
01:19:31,494 --> 01:19:33,954
Watch out, Steve.
I got him. Move off.

953
01:19:35,247 --> 01:19:38,709
Put it out!

954
01:19:38,793 --> 01:19:41,003
Stretcher!

955
01:19:41,045 --> 01:19:43,422
Get the goddamn stretcher.

956
01:19:43,506 --> 01:19:47,968
Everybody over here.
Through here. Through here.

957
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:50,346
Get that stretcher over here.

958
01:19:50,388 --> 01:19:54,975
What the hell happened?
Oh, my God! Tim!

959
01:19:55,017 --> 01:19:57,061
Tim! How'd it happen?

960
01:19:57,103 --> 01:19:59,397
Breathe, Tim, breathe.

961
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:03,109
Get him in there!

962
01:20:03,192 --> 01:20:05,486
Come on!

963
01:20:05,569 --> 01:20:08,989
- You're all right.
- Come on! Hang on, kid!

964
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:52,742
- Hey, Shadow, I got one here.
- Oh, Christ.

965
01:20:54,827 --> 01:20:56,787
Some guy named Holcomb.

966
01:21:02,168 --> 01:21:06,848
Steve.

967
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:09,675
Steve, you all right?

968
01:21:30,196 --> 01:21:33,491
- How is he?
- He's alive.

969
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:42,917
- Is he gonna make it?
- They're not saying.

970
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,378
He's in there.

971
01:21:48,547 --> 01:21:50,508
I'm sorry.
You can't come in now.

972
01:21:50,549 --> 01:21:52,551
Please stay outside.

973
01:21:56,972 --> 01:21:58,933
I should have been there.

974
01:21:59,016 --> 01:22:00,851
None of us should
have been there, Brian.

975
01:22:03,938 --> 01:22:06,023
Don't tell me
about the chance I'm taking.

976
01:22:06,065 --> 01:22:08,275
- You were costing me time.
- You didn't wait for back-up.

977
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:12,071
- You were wrong.
- What the hell is your problem?

978
01:22:14,573 --> 01:22:16,659
- This part of your investigation?
- You had to do it.

979
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,994
You had to be myth man,
taking another fire bare-handed...

980
01:22:19,036 --> 01:22:21,205
-instead of looking out for your probie.
-We need space.

981
01:22:21,247 --> 01:22:24,041
- Is that what happened?
- I had that fire. He didn't listen.

982
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:26,293
He's a candidate,
your responsibility.

983
01:22:26,377 --> 01:22:28,295
You shouldn't have had him
up there in the first place.

984
01:22:28,379 --> 01:22:30,339
You burned him, Stephen.

985
01:22:30,381 --> 01:22:33,384
- Fuck you.
- Don't you walk away from me.

986
01:22:46,731 --> 01:22:48,733
Yo, Brian. Let's go.

987
01:22:48,774 --> 01:22:51,819
Goddamn it!
Get him off!

988
01:22:51,902 --> 01:22:54,238
Come on!

989
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:55,948
Easy, man.

990
01:22:56,031 --> 01:22:57,992
Loosen up!
You're just making things worse.

991
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:01,328
- Relax. Forget about it.
- Come on. Come on.

992
01:23:27,646 --> 01:23:31,192
- Inspector.
- Alderman.

993
01:23:36,906 --> 01:23:38,824
Chinese sponge cake?

994
01:23:38,908 --> 01:23:41,368
When are you gonna catch
the prick that's doing this, Don?

995
01:23:41,452 --> 01:23:44,538
- Don?
- Don't you have any leads?

996
01:23:44,622 --> 01:23:47,166
No, Marty, I don't.

997
01:23:47,249 --> 01:23:50,044
We haven't found any connection
between the victims at all.

998
01:23:51,378 --> 01:23:53,672
Jesus Christ.
Open your eyes.

999
01:23:53,756 --> 01:23:55,800
You got Seagrave, Cosgrove...

1000
01:23:55,883 --> 01:23:58,219
- and now Holcomb.
- Holcomb?

1001
01:23:58,302 --> 01:24:01,472
Put 'em together.
It's a goddamn list.

1002
01:24:01,555 --> 01:24:06,185
I didn't know the name of
that victim had been released.

1003
01:24:21,033 --> 01:24:24,161
- Hey, John.
- Morning.

1004
01:24:28,374 --> 01:24:31,585
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

1005
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:38,175
I want to help you nail
that son-of-a-bitch that burned Tim.

1006
01:24:38,259 --> 01:24:41,846
Show me how.

1007
01:24:51,522 --> 01:24:54,817
Thought old Marty was
acting a little strange.

1008
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:59,655
He's right.
There's residue.

1009
01:24:59,697 --> 01:25:02,116
Holcomb is the third victim.

1010
01:25:04,535 --> 01:25:07,371
The backdraft was set up
somewhere in there.

1011
01:25:07,413 --> 01:25:10,958
Fried Holcomb
when he opened the inner door.

1012
01:25:12,209 --> 01:25:14,670
But the outer door held
and it waited for Tim.

1013
01:25:18,507 --> 01:25:21,177
In a word, Brian,

1014
01:25:21,218 --> 01:25:23,763
what is this job all about?

1015
01:25:23,846 --> 01:25:25,514
Fire.

1016
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:45,076
It's a living thing, Brian.

1017
01:25:45,117 --> 01:25:48,662
It breathes, it eats,

1018
01:25:48,746 --> 01:25:50,748
and it hates.

1019
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:54,335
The only way to beat it...

1020
01:25:54,418 --> 01:25:56,921
is to think like it;

1021
01:25:57,004 --> 01:26:00,257
to know this flame will spread
this way across the door...

1022
01:26:00,341 --> 01:26:02,259
and up across the ceiling;

1023
01:26:02,343 --> 01:26:04,762
not because of the physics
of flammable liquids,

1024
01:26:04,845 --> 01:26:07,640
but because it wants to.

1025
01:26:07,723 --> 01:26:12,228
Some guys, fire owns 'em.
Makes 'em fight it on its level.

1026
01:26:12,269 --> 01:26:15,898
But the only way to truly kill it...

1027
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:20,152
is to love it a little,
just like Ronald.

1028
01:26:36,293 --> 01:26:38,921
- Hi.
- Hi.

1029
01:26:38,963 --> 01:26:43,217
- I heard your friend's gonna be okay.
- Thanks.

1030
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,386
We checked and your boss
was partners...

1031
01:26:45,469 --> 01:26:48,472
with all the murder victims
in a company called Lakeside Dynamics.

1032
01:26:48,556 --> 01:26:52,143
He's keeping that a secret.
I wanna know why.

1033
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:00,609
- I don't know anything about that.
- You might be able to find out.

1034
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:04,321
- Get me his files.
- Do you know what you're asking?

1035
01:27:04,363 --> 01:27:05,698
Yeah.

1036
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:09,118
Four years ago I was punching
a cash register.

1037
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,704
Two years ago, Marty Swayzak
didn't even know my name.

1038
01:27:11,787 --> 01:27:13,706
I was bringing
the guy coffee.

1039
01:27:13,789 --> 01:27:16,333
I practically run
that office now.

1040
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:19,962
And Marty-
He believes in me.

1041
01:27:20,004 --> 01:27:22,548
I just don't-

1042
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,552
You're asking me to
throw that all away.

1043
01:27:26,635 --> 01:27:29,138
Your boss is a liar.

1044
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:54,371
Stephen?

1045
01:27:54,455 --> 01:27:58,292
I'm sorry, Helen.
I just couldn't sleep.

1046
01:28:01,712 --> 01:28:04,381
Well, what's wrong?

1047
01:28:04,465 --> 01:28:07,426
It used to be real clear.

1048
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:09,428
When I was a kid,

1049
01:28:11,806 --> 01:28:15,393
what meant most to me
about this job was...

1050
01:28:15,476 --> 01:28:17,895
no "ifs. "

1051
01:28:17,937 --> 01:28:21,399
Somebody called
the fire department, we came.

1052
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,235
We just showed up.

1053
01:28:28,614 --> 01:28:31,534
Those guys, they just don't know
how much I love 'em.

1054
01:28:37,706 --> 01:28:40,668
You don't leave people hangin'.

1055
01:28:44,088 --> 01:28:47,174
It holds everything up,
doesn't it?

1056
01:28:47,258 --> 01:28:50,261
Loyalty.

1057
01:28:50,344 --> 01:28:52,346
I don't get it.

1058
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:56,350
"Till death do us part. "
Isn't that what you heard, Helen?

1059
01:28:56,434 --> 01:28:59,729
You go, we go.
It's all the same...

1060
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:01,814
piece of shit without that,
isn't it?

1061
01:29:01,897 --> 01:29:06,193
It's the end of everything.

1062
01:29:11,866 --> 01:29:14,910
I'm sorry I came.

1063
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:20,082
There's just nobody
I can talk to.

1064
01:29:27,214 --> 01:29:30,301
I really miss you.

1065
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:19,683
You sure you really want
to put grape jelly in the eggs?

1066
01:30:19,725 --> 01:30:23,312
Yeah, it's part of my formula.
It's an experiment.

1067
01:30:23,354 --> 01:30:25,356
- It's an experiment?
- Yeah.

1068
01:30:25,398 --> 01:30:27,358
Let's get these eggs going.

1069
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,485
- Hey, I want to do that.
- Can you do it?

1070
01:30:29,527 --> 01:30:33,447
That's good.

1071
01:30:35,533 --> 01:30:38,327
I'll put that in the formula.

1072
01:30:38,369 --> 01:30:40,496
- You gonna leave the shells?
- Yeah.

1073
01:30:40,538 --> 01:30:43,666
- They're part of the formula?
- Yeah.

1074
01:30:43,707 --> 01:30:47,211
I guess you know
what you're doing.

1075
01:30:47,253 --> 01:30:51,132
- I know what I'm doing.

1076
01:30:51,215 --> 01:30:53,134
Mom!

1077
01:30:53,217 --> 01:30:55,845
I didn't know
you'd be up so early.

1078
01:30:55,886 --> 01:30:59,515
Mom, go back to bed.
We're making you breakfast in bed.

1079
01:31:05,396 --> 01:31:08,065
- Stephen, can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

1080
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:10,735
You keep going there.
You're doing good.

1081
01:31:10,776 --> 01:31:12,737
He knows what he's doin'.

1082
01:31:12,778 --> 01:31:17,199
He told me he likes those piano lessons
you got him taking.

1083
01:31:17,241 --> 01:31:20,995
It's just I don't want
to confuse him, you know.

1084
01:31:21,078 --> 01:31:25,124
I knew who you were
when we got married.

1085
01:31:25,207 --> 01:31:27,418
I knew how you did things.

1086
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,839
And-

1087
01:31:32,923 --> 01:31:36,385
I mean, you haven't-

1088
01:31:36,427 --> 01:31:38,637
I just can't anymore.

1089
01:31:38,721 --> 01:31:41,807
I just- you know,

1090
01:31:41,891 --> 01:31:46,103
I gotta worry about Sean.

1091
01:31:46,187 --> 01:31:49,106
- Yeah.
- I mean, you're the best.

1092
01:31:49,148 --> 01:31:51,525
You really are.

1093
01:31:51,609 --> 01:31:55,613
But the chances
that you take just-

1094
01:31:58,199 --> 01:32:00,785
You scare me now.

1095
01:32:09,043 --> 01:32:11,170
Sean.

1096
01:32:11,253 --> 01:32:13,923
Listen, I, uh-

1097
01:32:13,964 --> 01:32:15,966
I blew it.

1098
01:32:16,008 --> 01:32:18,636
I forgot that
I gotta work this morning.

1099
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,639
So, um-

1100
01:32:21,722 --> 01:32:24,642
That's all right.
We'll just do it again next Saturday.

1101
01:32:24,725 --> 01:32:27,520
- All right?
- Mom's crying.

1102
01:32:41,617 --> 01:32:44,829
The latest polls came in, Marty.

1103
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:51,544
Marty?

1104
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,680
Jesus Christ, Marty.

1105
01:33:02,722 --> 01:33:06,350
What's going on?

1106
01:33:06,434 --> 01:33:09,770
We have a city planners
meeting in 15 minutes.

1107
01:33:09,854 --> 01:33:12,898
Marty.

1108
01:33:20,654 --> 01:33:22,700
You've gotta level with me, Marty.

1109
01:33:22,783 --> 01:33:26,746
Is there something about
these deaths you're not telling me?

1110
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:31,041
No.

1111
01:33:54,482 --> 01:33:57,902
- What's this?
- Just take it.

1112
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:19,840
Rimgale's gonna wanna
talk to Swayzak about this.

1113
01:34:22,176 --> 01:34:23,761
I'm sorry.

1114
01:34:25,888 --> 01:34:30,101
- That's a dumb thing to say.
- You're right.

1115
01:34:32,144 --> 01:34:34,438
Good-bye, Brian.

1116
01:34:40,277 --> 01:34:42,863
What the hell you do
with this thing?

1117
01:34:42,947 --> 01:34:45,116
What do you mean?
I drove it, Joe.

1118
01:34:45,157 --> 01:34:48,119
This is a copy of Swayzak's report
that we know is bullshit;

1119
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,288
but we could never argue with
the numbers because they're airtight.

1120
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:54,166
This file she gave you
proves it's phoney.

1121
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:57,711
I checked on the firm that recommended
the cuts to Swayzak's task force.

1122
01:34:57,795 --> 01:35:00,131
They've done exactly one job,
a manpower study.

1123
01:35:00,214 --> 01:35:03,134
I checked further and it's not even
a company. No employees... nothing.

1124
01:35:03,217 --> 01:35:06,804
- Just a P.O. box.
- I wonder who wrote that report.

1125
01:35:06,887 --> 01:35:10,057
- Someone who knows how to work numbers.
- Exactly.

1126
01:35:10,141 --> 01:35:13,811
Like a bunch of
dead financial wizards.

1127
01:35:13,853 --> 01:35:17,690
- Seagrave, Holcomb, Cosgrove-
- And Swayzak.

1128
01:35:17,773 --> 01:35:20,901
Why did he go through
this trouble to cut firehouses?

1129
01:35:20,985 --> 01:35:24,405
When a firehouse closes, Swayzak
converts it into a community center.

1130
01:35:24,488 --> 01:35:27,116
- That's sweet.
- Lakeside Dynamics, remember them?

1131
01:35:27,158 --> 01:35:29,493
They get all
the expensive construction work.

1132
01:35:29,535 --> 01:35:31,954
I'm telling you,
this is a total scam.

1133
01:35:31,996 --> 01:35:35,166
These guys were
making a ton of money.

1134
01:35:35,249 --> 01:35:39,253
It's time we had a little talk
with Mr. Swayzak. Let's go.

1135
01:35:58,856 --> 01:36:01,192
Mr. Swayzak?

1136
01:36:06,197 --> 01:36:08,365
Gas. Check in there.

1137
01:36:52,952 --> 01:36:55,037
Come on. Come on!

1138
01:37:10,386 --> 01:37:13,472
- Let's go. Come on!

1139
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:41,000
- Hey, kid.

1140
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:44,462
I think I've got
a problem here.

1141
01:37:50,134 --> 01:37:54,513
Is it true that you were rescued
by the fire department's arson team?

1142
01:37:54,597 --> 01:37:57,308
That's quite a bunch
of guys, huh?

1143
01:37:59,602 --> 01:38:02,772
I'm so goddamn helpless here.

1144
01:38:02,855 --> 01:38:05,191
I can't do a fucking thing.

1145
01:38:08,569 --> 01:38:12,948
- What do you want me to do?
- I've been lying here thinkin'.

1146
01:38:13,032 --> 01:38:17,953
For hours... thinkin'
and thinkin' and thinkin'.

1147
01:38:18,037 --> 01:38:21,707
We're close.
We're close.

1148
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:23,709
But we're not lookin'
in the right place,

1149
01:38:23,793 --> 01:38:25,711
not in the right place.

1150
01:38:29,465 --> 01:38:34,178
So, you've come to pick
Ronald's brains...

1151
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:38,474
because nobody knows
the animal like Ronald.

1152
01:38:45,398 --> 01:38:48,150
It must've looked like
it was going to be...

1153
01:38:48,234 --> 01:38:51,946
a medium deal, didn't it,
when your father bought it?

1154
01:38:52,029 --> 01:38:54,365
What?

1155
01:38:54,407 --> 01:38:59,407
Did you watch him when he made
that ballsy jump and saved-

1156
01:39:00,204 --> 01:39:02,373
I didn't come to talk
about my father.

1157
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:08,054
I sent away for a copy of that "Life"
with your picture on the cover.

1158
01:39:08,838 --> 01:39:11,215
It's a collectible.

1159
01:39:11,257 --> 01:39:14,385
- Who's doing this, Ronald?
- Wrong question.

1160
01:39:14,427 --> 01:39:16,887
Who isn't?

1161
01:39:16,929 --> 01:39:19,056
It isn't a spark, is it?
Because there isn't enough damage...

1162
01:39:19,098 --> 01:39:21,475
and he wouldn't
have had any fun.

1163
01:39:21,559 --> 01:39:25,396
It isn't an insurance pro
because there isn't any profit.

1164
01:39:25,438 --> 01:39:27,940
- Who does that leave us with?
- What's his tool?

1165
01:39:28,023 --> 01:39:31,986
How does he do it?
How does he talk to the fire?

1166
01:39:32,069 --> 01:39:35,614
- The outlets.
- No.

1167
01:39:35,698 --> 01:39:38,951
That's a probie.
That's beneath you, Brian.

1168
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:45,332
Trychtichlorate.

1169
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:48,961
Very good. Very good.

1170
01:39:49,003 --> 01:39:53,340
You still haven't
put it together?

1171
01:39:53,424 --> 01:39:55,634
- I have.
- Then who, Ronald?

1172
01:39:55,718 --> 01:39:59,847
You wanna know who?

1173
01:40:01,974 --> 01:40:05,269
I wanna know...

1174
01:40:05,311 --> 01:40:09,440
if this kid
really wanted to be...

1175
01:40:09,482 --> 01:40:11,692
just like his dad.

1176
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:19,241
Did he?

1177
01:40:24,038 --> 01:40:25,998
Okay.

1178
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,542
I'm outta here.

1179
01:40:28,626 --> 01:40:32,713
All right!
I wanted to be him, okay?

1180
01:40:38,969 --> 01:40:41,180
I wanted to be him
more than anything.

1181
01:40:41,263 --> 01:40:43,641
You loved him.

1182
01:40:43,682 --> 01:40:47,019
Yeah.

1183
01:40:47,103 --> 01:40:51,690
You watched him dance with the animal.
You saw your dad burn.

1184
01:40:51,774 --> 01:40:55,152
Fuck you, Ronald!
Who the hell's doin' this?

1185
01:40:55,194 --> 01:40:58,280
Did it look at you?

1186
01:41:00,324 --> 01:41:02,576
Did the fire look at you?

1187
01:41:05,454 --> 01:41:08,499
It did.

1188
01:41:25,975 --> 01:41:30,312
Our worlds aren't
that far apart, are they?

1189
01:41:30,396 --> 01:41:33,274
So...

1190
01:41:33,357 --> 01:41:38,204
whoever did this really knows
the animal well, don't they?

1191
01:41:38,988 --> 01:41:42,616
They know him real well
but they won't let him loose.

1192
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,119
They won't let him have fun
so they don't love him.

1193
01:41:45,202 --> 01:41:47,955
Who doesn't love fire...

1194
01:41:48,038 --> 01:41:51,625
and is around trychtichlorate
all day long?

1195
01:41:51,709 --> 01:41:54,545
Oh, my God!

1196
01:41:59,717 --> 01:42:03,554
That wasn't such a long walk
after all, was it?

1197
01:42:16,942 --> 01:42:19,737
Oh, my God.

1198
01:42:22,281 --> 01:42:24,617
Goddamn it, Stephen.

1199
01:42:32,792 --> 01:42:37,713
Hey, what's goin' on?

1200
01:42:37,797 --> 01:42:42,426
I just came by to see
how you were doing.

1201
01:42:43,427 --> 01:42:46,639
How am I doin'?

1202
01:42:46,722 --> 01:42:50,267
Well, I'm sellin' Dad's boat.

1203
01:42:53,104 --> 01:42:56,982
Guy comin' by in a few minutes
to take a look at it.

1204
01:42:58,984 --> 01:43:00,903
What are you gonna do?

1205
01:43:00,986 --> 01:43:04,490
I mean, where you going?

1206
01:43:07,535 --> 01:43:10,579
I didn't say I was goin' anywhere.

1207
01:43:13,165 --> 01:43:15,334
Look, I gotta-
I gotta get back.

1208
01:43:15,376 --> 01:43:18,003
- There's somethin' I'm supposed to do.
- What?

1209
01:43:18,045 --> 01:43:20,840
What do you gotta do?

1210
01:43:23,175 --> 01:43:25,636
Look at you.

1211
01:43:25,678 --> 01:43:30,099
Look at your face!
All the things you must be thinkin'.

1212
01:43:30,182 --> 01:43:33,853
You really hate my guts,
don't you?

1213
01:43:33,936 --> 01:43:37,523
You know something, Brian?
That's all right.

1214
01:43:37,565 --> 01:43:39,984
- Maybe we should talk about it-
- You don't like me...

1215
01:43:40,025 --> 01:43:43,237
because I was no genius in the way
I raised you. Is that it?

1216
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:46,449
Dad was gone!
What was I supposed to do?

1217
01:43:46,532 --> 01:43:49,368
- You tell me.
- Forget it. It's okay.

1218
01:43:49,452 --> 01:43:52,788
I tried. I wanted so
many things for you...

1219
01:43:52,872 --> 01:43:55,791
that I couldn't even hope for.

1220
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:59,712
Because after that,
I had no choices!

1221
01:44:05,885 --> 01:44:09,388
Well, I'm not your father.

1222
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,557
You got somewhere to go, go.

1223
01:44:19,106 --> 01:44:22,068
People change, huh, Brian?

1224
01:44:22,109 --> 01:44:24,945
Sometimes right
when you're lookin' at 'em.

1225
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:30,910
What's going on with you?

1226
01:44:30,993 --> 01:44:34,455
I don't know.

1227
01:44:34,538 --> 01:44:36,874
Do you?

1228
01:44:37,916 --> 01:44:39,418
I gotta go.

1229
01:46:23,814 --> 01:46:27,359
Attention,
all units responding.

1230
01:46:27,401 --> 01:46:31,697
This is gonna be a hazardous materials
response at a chemical plant.

1231
01:46:38,621 --> 01:46:41,916
- Stephen? Has Stephen gotten back yet?
- He just pulled up.

1232
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:51,592
- Is it Adcox?
- How do you know?

1233
01:46:56,430 --> 01:47:00,985
I didn't until you came to the boat
lookin' for those chemicals.

1234
01:47:01,727 --> 01:47:04,021
- Lookin' for me.
- What were they doing on the boat?

1235
01:47:04,063 --> 01:47:06,357
Axe gave 'em to me.
They're cleaning shit.

1236
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:08,442
- We gotta roll!
- I'll be there in a minute.

1237
01:47:08,609 --> 01:47:10,569
I gotta go to Rimgale
with this.

1238
01:47:10,611 --> 01:47:13,155
- They're pullin' a box.
- I'll be there!

1239
01:47:13,197 --> 01:47:15,366
- Stephen!
- Wait! I'm his lieutenant.

1240
01:47:15,408 --> 01:47:17,493
I'll handle it.

1241
01:47:18,744 --> 01:47:20,746
Stephen?

1242
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:23,040
Are you a part of this?

1243
01:47:24,624 --> 01:47:25,701
No.

1244
01:47:26,085 --> 01:47:28,963
You're sure?

1245
01:47:29,046 --> 01:47:32,842
That's the only thing
I am sure of anymore.

1246
01:47:32,925 --> 01:47:35,302
Bull, we need you.

1247
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:48,149
Jesus Christ!

1248
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:50,025
Stephen!

1249
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:56,574
Stephen!

1250
01:47:56,657 --> 01:47:58,659
Shit!

1251
01:48:57,385 --> 01:48:59,553
Get out of the way!

1252
01:49:15,528 --> 01:49:18,197
- You all right?
- You all right, Peng?

1253
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,282
- Everybody all right?
- You okay?

1254
01:49:20,366 --> 01:49:22,368
Yeah. Help me out.

1255
01:49:38,426 --> 01:49:40,845
Where's 17?

1256
01:49:40,928 --> 01:49:43,013
- I don't know.
- Shit!

1257
01:49:45,975 --> 01:49:48,144
Stephen!

1258
01:49:50,938 --> 01:49:53,899
- Where's 17?
- 17's on the roof.

1259
01:49:53,941 --> 01:49:57,069
Mask up.
We got a chemical fire.

1260
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,323
We're pullin' the plug.

1261
01:50:42,406 --> 01:50:45,576
Everybody off the roof, now!

1262
01:50:45,659 --> 01:50:48,746
- Jesus Christ, Axe.
- You don't understand.

1263
01:50:48,829 --> 01:50:52,166
My cousin, Sally,
used to work at Swayzak's office.

1264
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:54,251
She saw the files.
She saw what he did.

1265
01:50:54,335 --> 01:50:57,171
- You set me up with those chemicals?
- I'm tryin' to explain.

1266
01:50:57,254 --> 01:50:59,757
- Stephen.
- You back off!

1267
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,009
- Axe.
- Somebody had to stop these pricks.

1268
01:51:02,093 --> 01:51:05,346
- Are you thinkin'? You burned people!
- You didn't see.

1269
01:51:05,388 --> 01:51:09,683
- You're a fireman.
- When Sally showed me Swayzak's files-

1270
01:51:09,725 --> 01:51:12,728
- I should've let you in on it.
- In on murder?

1271
01:51:12,812 --> 01:51:17,316
Those assholes were closin' firehouses,
gettin' our friends killed for money.

1272
01:51:17,358 --> 01:51:20,945
- I had to do it for the department!
- For Tim?

1273
01:51:20,986 --> 01:51:23,489
- That was an accident.
- Did you start that fire?

1274
01:51:23,572 --> 01:51:26,784
Why'd you have to go
in there so fucking early?

1275
01:51:26,826 --> 01:51:28,786
That's why you
wanted me to wait.

1276
01:51:28,828 --> 01:51:31,330
- Let me finish Swayzak!
- No. It's over.

1277
01:51:31,414 --> 01:51:34,959
Your dad would puke if he saw
how you shit on his department.

1278
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,713
- What would he say about what you do?
- Your dad died...

1279
01:51:38,796 --> 01:51:42,675
saving my life, and these people
were killin' firemen for money.

1280
01:51:42,758 --> 01:51:46,262
- Swayzak.
- He killed our friends for money.

1281
01:51:46,345 --> 01:51:48,264
What the fuck would you do?

1282
01:51:48,347 --> 01:51:51,726
You're his lieutenant.
You've gotta handle this.

1283
01:51:55,187 --> 01:51:57,106
It's going!

1284
01:51:57,189 --> 01:52:00,276
Get to the side!
It's gonna go!

1285
01:52:47,114 --> 01:52:51,243
17! Somebody!
I'm in the elevator shaft.

1286
01:52:51,285 --> 01:52:52,828
Help me!

1287
01:53:07,635 --> 01:53:10,930
Help, somebody!

1288
01:53:18,437 --> 01:53:22,149
17, help!

1289
01:53:32,952 --> 01:53:35,788
- Brian!
- Stephen!

1290
01:53:35,871 --> 01:53:39,417
I'm burning up in here!

1291
01:53:52,012 --> 01:53:54,473
- You all right?
- Yeah. You all right?

1292
01:53:58,642 --> 01:54:00,688
Come on.
We gotta go get him.

1293
01:54:00,771 --> 01:54:04,608
We gotta get outta here.
The whole place is goin' up.

1294
01:54:17,455 --> 01:54:20,875
Look out!
Come on. This way.

1295
01:54:35,848 --> 01:54:38,184
Wait a minute. Brian!

1296
01:54:39,268 --> 01:54:41,645
Jesus!

1297
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:30,361
I just couldn't
let it go, Bull.

1298
01:55:32,403 --> 01:55:33,989
Yeah.

1299
01:56:02,768 --> 01:56:05,730
- I got ya.

1300
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,814
Let me go, Bull.

1301
01:56:49,899 --> 01:56:54,820
You go... we go.

1302
01:57:00,618 --> 01:57:03,412
Stephen!

1303
01:57:07,333 --> 01:57:10,169
Nooo!

1304
01:57:31,232 --> 01:57:33,192
Don't move.

1305
01:57:37,321 --> 01:57:39,281
Don't move, damn it.

1306
01:57:39,365 --> 01:57:41,867
- What?
- Just lie down.

1307
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:49,333
Oh, shit!

1308
01:57:54,213 --> 01:57:57,550
Pengelly, up here!

1309
01:57:57,591 --> 01:58:00,886
Did you hear somebody?
Stephen!

1310
01:58:00,970 --> 01:58:04,306
- Pengelly!
- Up here!

1311
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:06,308
- Where's he at?
- Over there!

1312
01:58:06,392 --> 01:58:07,977
Pengelly!

1313
01:58:10,438 --> 01:58:13,065
We're gonna get you outta here.
Lay down. Don't move.

1314
01:58:19,405 --> 01:58:21,741
Get goin'!

1315
01:58:26,412 --> 01:58:29,206
Pengelly, I lost the line.

1316
01:58:41,551 --> 01:58:42,887
I'm going for the hose.

1317
01:59:25,429 --> 01:59:27,431
Brian!

1318
01:59:41,237 --> 01:59:44,115
- Go!
- All right, move it!

1319
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:08,347
Come on.

1320
02:00:24,196 --> 02:00:26,365
Look at him.

1321
02:00:26,449 --> 02:00:29,076
That's my brother,
goddamn it.

1322
02:00:41,881 --> 02:00:43,841
How is he?
Is he okay?

1323
02:00:45,092 --> 02:00:49,522
- Let's move it. Let's go.
- Hang on.

1324
02:00:50,264 --> 02:00:52,224
Let's move it, now!

1325
02:00:52,266 --> 02:00:55,102
- Up with him!
- Come on.

1326
02:00:55,186 --> 02:00:59,982
- All right, Bull.
- He's gonna make it.

1327
02:01:08,199 --> 02:01:10,576
I gotta get this collar on.
Come on. Help us out.

1328
02:01:10,618 --> 02:01:12,578
I don't want it.

1329
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:15,581
Brian?

1330
02:01:15,623 --> 02:01:19,928
Don't tell them about Adcox.
Don't let them.

1331
02:01:20,711 --> 02:01:23,756
- It'll hurt the department.
- I won't.

1332
02:01:23,798 --> 02:01:28,228
- Monitor on.
- I'm sorry. I thought-

1333
02:01:28,969 --> 02:01:30,182
90 over 60.

1334
02:01:33,265 --> 02:01:35,267
I'm sorry
I ever thought you-

1335
02:01:35,351 --> 02:01:39,063
I know.

1336
02:01:43,943 --> 02:01:47,696
- I- I beat it.
- Blood pressure: 80 over 60.

1337
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:49,949
The fire never got me.

1338
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:51,909
Hang in there.

1339
02:01:51,951 --> 02:01:54,036
- You're gonna make it!

1340
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:56,038
Lidocaine, now!

1341
02:01:56,122 --> 02:01:58,916
- Is he going to be all right?
- He's spiking!

1342
02:02:01,001 --> 02:02:03,838
Who's your brother, Brian?

1343
02:02:06,632 --> 02:02:09,468
You are, Stephen.

1344
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:15,518
Lidocaine in.

1345
02:02:22,481 --> 02:02:26,152
I'm tired of hearing
the sirens.

1346
02:02:26,235 --> 02:02:30,990
Turn... turn the siren off, Brian.

1347
02:02:32,324 --> 02:02:34,660
Turn the siren off.

1348
02:02:34,744 --> 02:02:36,662
You're gonna be all right,
goddamn it!

1349
02:02:36,746 --> 02:02:40,249
Hang in! Let's go!
Move this thing.

1350
02:02:40,332 --> 02:02:42,793
Don't you die on me now.
You hear me?

1351
02:02:42,835 --> 02:02:45,546
Hang in there.
We're almost there.

1352
02:02:45,629 --> 02:02:48,674
It's not your time now.
I need you.

1353
02:02:55,846 --> 02:02:57,767
You're gonna make it.

1354
02:02:59,852 --> 02:03:02,688
Clear!

1355
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:07,193
Starting compression.
One, two, three, four, five.

1356
02:03:08,569 --> 02:03:11,864
One, two, three,
four, five.

1357
02:03:11,947 --> 02:03:16,744
One, two, three, four, five.

1358
02:03:16,827 --> 02:03:18,996
One, two-

1359
02:05:01,015 --> 02:05:03,851
In the Chicago fire department...

1360
02:05:03,934 --> 02:05:06,145
the alarm code 3-3-5 signifies...

1361
02:05:06,187 --> 02:05:09,523
that the company has
returned home to quarters.

1362
02:05:09,607 --> 02:05:13,152
We will now ring out
that code to welcome home...

1363
02:05:13,235 --> 02:05:17,990
Firefighter John Adcox and
Lieutenant Stephen McCaffrey.

1364
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:47,895
Honor guard,
hand salute!

1365
02:05:53,734 --> 02:05:58,322
Honor guard, dismissed!

1366
02:06:20,261 --> 02:06:22,430
Gentlemen, can we help you?

1367
02:06:22,471 --> 02:06:26,267
Police. We have a subpoena
for Alderman Swayzak.

1368
02:06:26,308 --> 02:06:29,270
- Ah, Inspector-
- Alderman Swayzak, how are you doin'?

1369
02:06:29,353 --> 02:06:33,899
- This will only take a minute.
- I'm in a press conference.

1370
02:06:33,941 --> 02:06:37,111
These detectives would like to
question you why you secretly paid...

1371
02:06:37,153 --> 02:06:39,572
Donald Cosgrove, Jeffrey Holcomb,
and Alan Seagrave...

1372
02:06:39,613 --> 02:06:42,074
to create a phoney manpower study.

1373
02:06:42,116 --> 02:06:46,704
Ask him who made money
off firemen dying.

1374
02:06:51,625 --> 02:06:55,296
You see that glow flashing
in the corner of your eye?

1375
02:06:55,337 --> 02:06:57,965
That's your career
dissipation light.

1376
02:06:58,007 --> 02:07:00,968
It just went into high gear.

1377
02:07:04,305 --> 02:07:07,308
I'll have my aides look into it
as soon as they can. Thank you.

1378
02:07:07,391 --> 02:07:11,479
Mr. Alderman has no further comment.
This conference is over.

1379
02:07:34,043 --> 02:07:38,297
...1718 West Maplewood.

1380
02:07:38,339 --> 02:07:42,051
1718 West Maplewood.
Got it, Cap?

1381
02:07:43,803 --> 02:07:46,972
Okay, into the truck.
Code 32.

1382
02:07:49,183 --> 02:07:51,102
Nightengale!

1383
02:08:09,662 --> 02:08:11,789
We're gonna be damn busy.

1384
02:08:12,373 --> 02:08:14,333
Salsa!

1385
02:08:46,615 --> 02:08:49,869
You're doin' it wrong!

1386
02:08:59,962 --> 02:09:02,548
Thanks.

1387
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:05,009
All right.

1
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,805
Ozzie. Come on in.

2
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,657
Palmer. What's up?

3
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,799
You know Peck
and Olson.

4
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:46,230
Peck, yes, hiya.
Olson, by reputation.

5
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:50,484
I'm Osborne Cox.

6
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,763
Yeah, hi.

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,257
Aren't you with...
Isn't he...

8
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,630
Yeah, that's right.
Have a seat.

9
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:59,592
Look, Oz,
look.

10
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:02,065
There's no easy
way to say this.

11
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,556
We're taking you off
the Balkans desk.

12
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:08,625
What? Why?

13
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,698
In fact, we're moving you
out of SIGINT entirely.

14
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:15,792
Just... No discussion?
Just "You're out"?

15
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:18,745
Well, we're having
the discussion now.

16
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:23,415
Look, Oz, this doesn't
have to be unpleasant.

17
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:27,121
Palmer,
with all due respect,

18
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:30,609
what the fuck are
you talking about?

19
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,657
And why is
Olson here?

20
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:34,962
Ozzie, look...

21
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:36,148
What the fuck
is this?

22
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,943
I know it's not my work.
- Ozzie.

23
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm a great
fucking analyst.

24
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:40,664
Okay, Ozzie.

25
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:45,370
Ozzie, things have not been
going well, as you know.

26
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,607
You have
a drinking problem.

27
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,149
I have a drinking problem?

28
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,643
This doesn't have
to be unpleasant.

29
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:02,707
We found something for
you in State. It's a...

30
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:06,907
Well, it is a lower
clearance level. Yes.

31
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:11,928
But it's not...
Look, we're not terminating you.

32
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:13,302
Hmm.

33
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,677
This is an assault.

34
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:18,173
I have a drinking problem?

35
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,312
Fuck you, Peck. You're a Mormon!
- Ozzie.

36
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:23,066
Next to you, we all have
a drinking problem!

37
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:28,253
What the fuck is this?
Whose ass didn't I kiss? Huh?

38
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:29,945
Let's be honest!
- Okay...

39
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:32,918
I mean, let us
be fucking honest.

40
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:37,247
This is a crucifixion!
This is political!

41
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:39,614
And don't tell me it's not!

42
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:42,811
I have
a drinking problem!

43
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,952
You're home.

44
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:00,159
Honey, hang on to your hat.
I've got some news.

45
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:01,436
Did you pick up
the cheeses?

46
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,586
Huh?

47
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:04,064
The cheeses?
Were they ready?

48
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,145
The cheeses?

49
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,391
I didn't realize you
could be home so early.

50
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,306
Yeah. I left a message for
you to stop by Arnaud's.

51
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:12,061
The Magruders and the Pfarrers
are coming this evening.

52
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:15,197
The Pfarrers...
What did Kathleen say?

53
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:16,924
What?

54
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:18,622
When you left
the message?

55
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:20,859
That she would
give you the message.

56
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:23,036
Well, I don't know, I guess
we had bigger news today.

57
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,832
My day didn't revolve
around whether...

58
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,395
Do you mean that you
didn't pick up the cheeses?

59
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,843
Well, if I didn't
get the message,

60
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:28,990
then I didn't pick up
the cheeses.

61
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,752
For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
But, honey, hang on to your hat.

62
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,731
What, now I have to go and pick them up?
- I have some news to...

63
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,561
Stay here
and get dressed.

64
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,906
Honey,
we have to talk.

65
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:39,968
Well, not now. I mean, they're
gonna be here in less than an hour.

66
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,236
Is that goat cheese?

67
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:45,888
Chèvre, yes,
that is a goat cheese.

68
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,708
'Cause I have a lactose reflux,
and I can't...

69
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,368
You're lactose
intolerant?

70
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,358
Yeah, but I...
- Or you have acid reflux?

71
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,310
They're different things.
- I know what they are.

72
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,618
So you misspoke.

73
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,443
Well, thank you
for correcting me.

74
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,715
You should try the chèvre, Harry.
It's very good.

75
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,060
Yeah. I can
eat goat cheese.

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,233
I was just telling your
husband that I have a condition

77
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,021
where I go into
anaphylactic shock when I...

78
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,192
Harry works in the Marshals Service, Doug.
- And my throat...

79
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,120
Oh! I'm on
the legislative side.

80
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,323
I work with
Senator Hobby.

81
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:14,280
I was with Treasury, dealing
with Homeland Security.

82
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:15,556
I'm with the Marshals now.

83
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:17,992
If you want, he'll show
you his great big gun.

84
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:21,925
Very funny.
Gun's no big deal.

85
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:24,418
Twenty years of Marshals Service,
I never discharged my weapon.

86
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:27,911
That sounds like something you
should be telling your psychiatrist.

87
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:30,313
I don't have
a psychiatrist.

88
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,672
Boy, I guess my job
is pretty undramatic.

89
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,779
I'm on
the legislative side.

90
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,996
Mrs. Pfarrer,
what do you do?

91
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,146
Do you also
carry a big gun?

92
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:40,713
No, I write children's...

93
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,437
She writes
children's books.

94
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:45,824
<i>Yeah. Oliver, The Cat
Who Lives In The Rotunda.</i>

95
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,012
Those are wonderful!
- Thank you.

96
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:48,196
My nieces and nephews
just love them.

97
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,642
Oh! Yeah, it's a
beloved, beloved series.

98
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,113
Oh! Thank you.

99
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:52,838
You should see
the fan mail she gets.

100
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:54,658
Are you sure
this is goat cheese?

101
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:57,131
Why don't you let your wife tell
them about her own books, Harry?

102
00:05:57,197 --> 00:05:58,887
Come with me into the kitchen.
- I'm sorry. Was I dominating?

103
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,201
Help with
the crudités.

104
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:07,107
God damn it. He knows, doesn't he?
These are nice floors.

105
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,930
Knows what?
- About us, he knows about us.

106
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:11,404
Little prick.
- Don't be such an ass.

107
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,128
He doesn't know
a thing.

108
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:16,653
What is that, Forbo?

109
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,552
What a horse's ass.

110
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,215
I don't know why
we see them.

111
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:27,943
Well, she's all right.

112
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,436
She's a cold,
stuck-up bitch.

113
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,112
You quit?

114
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:40,493
Uh-huh.

115
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,804
Well, thank you
for telling me.

116
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,050
Well, I tried to
tell you this...

117
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,296
You tried?
You tried?

118
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:46,224
And then what,
aphasia kicked in?

119
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,198
No. Then our guests
came and then...

120
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,955
Why? For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
- I don't know.

121
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,967
I just got so tired.

122
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,154
You're tired?

123
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:56,559
Yes, of swimming
against the current.

124
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:57,901
Uh-huh.

125
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,415
Independent thought
is not valued there.

126
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,719
They resist it. They fight it.
The bureaucracy is...

127
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:07,633
So they gave you a pension
or severance or something?

128
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,309
I didn't retire. I quit.
I don't want their benefits.

129
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,647
But my benefits, they
will do you, right?

130
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,918
They'll see you through,
is that the idea?

131
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,963
It's not like that's the
only way to make money.

132
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,298
Yes? Yes? Well,
what're you gonna do?

133
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:23,665
I'll do some consulting.

134
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,193
Consulting.

135
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,120
Yes, to help out while...
I've always wanted to write.

136
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,931
Write. Write what?

137
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,530
I've been thinking
about writing a book.

138
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:44,307
Or, you know,
a sort of memoir.

139
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:59,057
You okay there, Dad?

140
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:11,573
Dad, I left my job
at the Agency.

141
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,202
I'm sorry, Dad.

142
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:26,262
Government service is not the
same as when you were in State.

143
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,854
Things are different now.

144
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:33,936
I don't know, maybe it's
the Cold War ending.

145
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,272
Now it seems like it's all
bureaucracy and no mission.

146
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,368
I'm writing a memoir.

147
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:50,005
I think it can be
pretty explosive.

148
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,409
But I don't think
you would disapprove.

149
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,875
I don't think you
would disapprove.

150
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,566
Katie's had trouble
accepting it.

151
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:59,864
But sometimes there's
a higher patriotism, Dad.

152
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,938
I know this kind of man.
We've seen this.

153
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:22,076
Mrs. Cox,
you cannot let this man

154
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:24,892
take advantage of you,
and he will.

155
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,972
He will.

156
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,573
Yes. This is my fear.

157
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,687
Though he's trying...
Well, he says

158
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:31,417
he's trying to pull
himself together but...

159
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:36,954
Yeah. Look, sure, I'm obliged to
tell you to try to salvage things,

160
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:39,771
and you should.
It's not unheard of

161
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,654
that people turn
themselves around,

162
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:47,608
but you haven't broached the
possibility of divorce yet.

163
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,535
No.
- Well, that's good.

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,626
Because first you should get his
financials before he's forewarned.

165
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:55,638
Because here is a man...

166
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:58,844
Here is a man
practiced in deceit.

167
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:01,280
This was almost,
you could say, it's his job,

168
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,777
and there is no reason
it's not improper.

169
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:09,210
There is no reason you shouldn't get
a picture of the household finances.

170
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:13,723
Paper files, computer files, whatever.
That's your prerogative.

171
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,345
You can be a spy,
too, madam.

172
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:20,930
Do this,
before he's put on alert.

173
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,337
Before the turtle can
draw in his head and his...

174
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,185
Feet.
- Feet.

175
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:30,593
And hopefully
everything will work out.

176
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,253
He will reform.

177
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:34,462
But if not,

178
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:38,369
forewarned is forearmed.

179
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:50,433
We were young and committed and
there was nothing we could not do.

180
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:54,683
We thought of
the Agency less...

181
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,132
Um...

182
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:04,900
The principles
of George Kennan,

183
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,877
a personal hero of mine,

184
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:13,085
like the fabled
Murrow's Boys,

185
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:18,496
at a time of...

186
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:30,398
<i>You have reached the Cox Group.</i>

187
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:32,862
<i>We can't answer
your call right...</i>

188
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,562
Hello?

189
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,323
<i>I'm looking for Dr. Cox. Is she there?</i>

190
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:41,029
No. She isn't.
Hers is the 5719 number.

191
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,952
This is the Cox Group,

192
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:46,531
but you can reach her on her
portable or at her office.

193
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,090
<i>She's married!</i>

194
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:50,884
<i>Number four.</i>

195
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:53,797
<i>Has a boyfriend!</i>

196
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,076
<i>And number six.</i>

197
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,925
<i>She's pregnant!</i>

198
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,287
I should try to
get a run in.

199
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:44,647
Ozzie!

200
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,270
Ozzie!

201
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:05,236
<i>Let all with one accord rejoice</i>

202
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:09,393
<i>In praise of Old Nassau</i>

203
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:12,048
<i>In praise of Old Nassau,
my boys</i>

204
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,997
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>

205
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:20,911
<i>Her sons will give
while they shall live</i>

206
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:23,701
<i>Three cheers for Old Nassau!</i>

207
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,277
We take all the chicken
fat off your buttocks, here.

208
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:32,879
Mmm-hmm.

209
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:38,197
And the upper arms.
- Mmm-hmm.

210
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:41,561
And a little off your tummy.
- Yeah. Great.

211
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,113
Now, we do
breast augmentation

212
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:47,384
with a tiny
incision here...

213
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,881
That marker tickles.

214
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,263
...and here.

215
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:53,144
And what about the upper leg,
the higher inside thigh area?

216
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,030
Well, we can do
liposuction there, as well,

217
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,951
but that area will
respond to exercise.

218
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:00,723
The buttocks and upper
arms begin to store more fat

219
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:05,082
once you get up around 40.
The body just tells it to go there,

220
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,733
but the thighs will
respond to toning exercises.

221
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:10,071
Yeah, I can work on my arms
till the cows come home, but...

222
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,336
Well, also, there are of
course genetic factors.

223
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:14,843
The Litzkes have
always been big.

224
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:15,889
Well, everyone's got...

225
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:18,266
My mother had an ass
that could pull a bus.

226
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:19,706
Wow! Well, that's a...

227
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:20,754
Father's side, too.

228
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:23,414
I mean, although Dad tended to
carry his weight out in front more,

229
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:25,045
in the gut area.
Derrière, not so much.

230
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:26,131
Okay.

231
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:29,368
And what about the face, you know,
the window to the soul?

232
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:30,646
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

233
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,375
Very well put.

234
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:36,950
Well, your eyes are one
of your best features,

235
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:41,308
but we can do something about
the incipient crow's feet.

236
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,228
Baby crow's feet.
Little chickling's feet.

237
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,984
I mean chicks.
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

238
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:47,290
Yes, again, well put.

239
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:49,213
You have a way
with words.

240
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,443
We make a small incision
and then pull the skin tight,

241
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,518
like stretching
the skin over a drum.

242
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,606
Not too tight, though.

243
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,687
We don't want that
"worked-on" look.

244
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,126
You need sufficient slack for
the face to remain expressive.

245
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:02,363
Yeah, I don't wanna
look like Boris Karloff.

246
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:04,121
So you don't want a sex change!

247
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:05,882
No, I'm all woman!

248
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:10,847
So, Linda, what we're talking about
here is four different procedures.

249
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,592
The liposuction,
the rhinoplasty,

250
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:18,270
the facial tuck, which I would strongly
recommend over the chemical peel.

251
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:19,776
Yeah, I don't wanna
burn anything off.

252
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:22,207
And why should you,
with that lovely skin?

253
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,478
And lastly,
the breast augmentation.

254
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:28,801
Now, we can also do something
about the vaccine scar.

255
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:32,572
I don't know if you wear
sleeveless dresses much...

256
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:34,071
Not with these ham hocks!

257
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,114
Yes, well, once they're
nice and svelte, post-op,

258
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:39,706
you may change
your mind about that.

259
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:41,945
I wanna talk about
this vaccine thing.

260
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:43,642
I mean, can you
counsel me on this?

261
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:45,177
I mean, is it
really that unsightly?

262
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:47,171
I see... I mean, a bunch
of people have them.

263
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:49,625
Absolutely!
Some women don't mind it.

264
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:51,868
It's personal taste.

265
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,234
Chad!

266
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:01,978
Big breath. Exhale.

267
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:04,318
Hold it.

268
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:05,338
Hold and release!

269
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:06,429
Chad!

270
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,641
And release.

271
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:11,358
Too much?

272
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:14,626
I just felt a straining,
a tightness in the front of my ass.

273
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,613
Well, you are pretty
tight down there.

274
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:17,756
You have to...

275
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:18,975
Yes, something
snapped in my ass.

276
00:17:19,014 --> 00:17:20,901
<i>Chad Feldheimer to the office, please.</i>

277
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,429
I'm gonna check with my office.
I'll be right back,

278
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:24,836
and we're gonna work
on opening those hips.

279
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,203
I just got a batch
from BeWithMeDC.com.

280
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:33,376
Oh, no. Anything good?

281
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,041
I don't know. I'm just
looking. How do I open this?

282
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:36,670
Click on the...
Click on the... Yeah...

283
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,368
Okay. Oh, my God!

284
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:39,649
Okay. Loser.

285
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,983
Loser. Loser.

286
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,436
They should
call this Mr. Loser.com.

287
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:47,682
Did you have to
send in a picture?

288
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:48,930
No, only the guys do.

289
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,375
I had to fill out
a verbal profile,

290
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:51,911
what turns me on,
what turns me off.

291
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:55,205
I'm really looking for a
guy with a sense of humor.

292
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,313
That guy... Wait. That guy wasn't bad.
- Him?

293
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,076
No, before.
- Him?

294
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,153
Yeah... He might
not be a loser.

295
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,338
How can you tell?

296
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,134
That's a Brioni suit.
- Yeah?

297
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:05,511
Shit, yeah.

298
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,748
Does he look like he would
have a sense of humor?

299
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,955
Looks like his optometrist
has a sense of humor.

300
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,433
What does he do?

301
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,187
State Department.

302
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,752
That's cool.

303
00:18:16,203 --> 00:18:18,342
His hair is...
- What is that?

304
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,985
Plugs?

305
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:27,045
This is our cardio area, and
we have a lot of machines,

306
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,577
so, believe me,
there's never a wait.

307
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,724
I mean, what you see now
is like our busiest time,

308
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:32,421
and there's like
a lot of machines open.

309
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:33,506
Hey, Chad.

310
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:35,239
Hey, Linda.
Did you call that guy?

311
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,124
No, not yet.
Chad Feldheimer, he's one of our trainers.

312
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,457
I've been doing this Internet
dating thing, and I...

313
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:41,703
What service?

314
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,148
BeWithMeDC.com.

315
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:44,739
Nice.
- Have you used them?

316
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:48,195
No. Two friends did, though,
and they both got hooked up

317
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,024
with really
special guys.

318
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,523
That's fantastic.

319
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,901
<i>If you're an English speaker,
please say, "Yes"...</i>

320
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,948
Yes!

321
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:56,843
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.</i>

322
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:58,852
<i>If you're an English speaker...
- English.</i>

323
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:00,836
<i>Would you like to speak to the
billing department or to an agent?</i>

324
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:01,925
Agent.

325
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,492
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.</i>

326
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,901
Agent! Agent!

327
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:08,680
<i>Hello.
Can I help you?</i>

328
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:10,889
Yeah, hi.
This is Linda Litzke.

329
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,520
Shall I give you
my account number?

330
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:14,957
<i>You keyed it in. I have it here.
- You have it up? Okay.</i>

331
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:17,578
I was told that I needed
pre-approval for these surgeries...

332
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,233
<i>Yes, I'm showing that this
procedure was not approved.</i>

333
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:21,929
Yes, it was denied.

334
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,749
<i>This operation is an elective procedure.
It's not covered by...</i>

335
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:28,110
No, those are four different operations.
It's very complicated.

336
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,151
I'm reinventing myself.
This is a whole new look,

337
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:33,192
so it's not just one thing, but
they're all approved by my doctor.

338
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,207
<i>Your doctor's approval
is not the issue, ma'am.</i>

339
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,005
<i>But this is not... Madam.
Our guidelines specify</i>

340
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,634
<i>that elective
surgeries are...</i>

341
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:41,259
My job involves
public interface.

342
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,054
<i>This is not...
- I'm afraid you don't understand...</i>

343
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:44,780
Oh! I understand.

344
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:47,021
Put your supervisor
on, please.

345
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:48,974
<i>Hold the line.</i>

346
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:34,163
Alan?

347
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,174
Linda?

348
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,031
Yeah.

349
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:45,838
<i>We've been over
and over and over this.</i>

350
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,661
<i>First you say you
can't commit, and then...</i>

351
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,189
<i>Would you come
down from there?</i>

352
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:33,945
We were married when I
was in my, what, mid-20s?

353
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:35,260
A kid.

354
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,948
We were kids, 20s.

355
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,351
You think it's forever.

356
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:44,697
You get older, you start
to feel your mortality,

357
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,974
and you say,
"There's no more time for dishonesty,

358
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:50,587
"for subterfuge."
You say, "I'm not that person."

359
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:52,088
The choices you make...

360
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,951
I'm thinking of
divorcing Ozzie.

361
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:01,634
Frankly, I'm thinking...

362
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:08,280
I guess that's what
I should be thinking, too.

363
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,144
With Sandy.

364
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:12,154
Well, that's what
you were just saying.

365
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:14,235
Absolutely, yes.

366
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:16,032
And you're right.
You should dump that bozo.

367
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,205
No question about it.
I agree.

368
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:20,478
So if I were divorced...

369
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,990
Yes, I should settle
things with Sandy

370
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:26,971
because of you and me.
- Mmm-hmm.

371
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,680
It's just, you know...

372
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:36,036
It's hard to inflict that
kind of pain, you know.

373
00:23:36,677 --> 00:23:39,296
Of course, that would
be easier for you.

374
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,394
Why's that?
I don't see that.

375
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,699
Well, because
he's such a dope,

376
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,662
and Sandy is a good lady.
She's a very special lady.

377
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:51,874
She's a cold,
stuck-up bitch.

378
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,732
That's a little...

379
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,489
You and I should
get things sorted.

380
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,664
I've always told you
it's more than just frivolity.

381
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,224
That's right. That's understood.
You've been very straight.

382
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:02,564
And I think I've been
loud and clear.

383
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,029
Absolutely.

384
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,848
Not just fun and games.

385
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,550
Absolutely.

386
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:33,288
<i>Agent!
- I'm sorry.</i>

387
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:34,817
<i>I didn't understand
what you said.</i>

388
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:36,067
Agent!

389
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:41,217
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

390
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,876
<i> Please stay on the
line for the next available agent.</i>

391
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:56,710
Ted, can I talk to you
about our Mickey Mouse HMO?

392
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,763
Uh-huh! Hang on.

393
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,013
This is some
heavy shit.

394
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:00,297
Is that my date list?

395
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:01,670
No, fuck.

396
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:03,781
You know, I'm trying to reinvent
myself, and these procedures,

397
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:06,024
which are so incredibly not cheap...
- What is that?

398
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:07,237
I can't believe this.

399
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,229
This is like
intelligence shit.

400
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:10,274
I'm not comfortable
with this.

401
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:11,875
This is like...
- What is it?

402
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:13,356
I can't believe
this shit I'm seeing.

403
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:14,861
Manolo found it.
On the floor there.

404
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,413
Yeah. Manolo found like this
CD just lying in a locker,

405
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:19,242
a locker floor, ladies' locker.
- Just lying there.

406
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:21,132
I'm like,
"What, someone's music or what?"

407
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:23,052
And I come in here,
and it's these files, man.

408
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,296
I'm not comfortable
with this.

409
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:28,296
Talking about SIGINT
and signals and shit and...

410
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:29,448
"Signals" means "code,"
you know.

411
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,567
It was just lying there.

412
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:33,802
Talking here about department
heads and their names and shit.

413
00:25:33,904 --> 00:25:36,938
And then there's these other
files that are just, like, numbers.

414
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:42,410
Arrayed. Numbers and dates and
numbers and number and dates.

415
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:44,455
And numbers and...

416
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:48,140
I think that's
the shit, man.

417
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:51,527
The raw intelligence.

418
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,159
I'm not touching this.

419
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:54,443
I want this out of here.

420
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:56,335
Just throw it out?
- No. You can't do that.

421
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,093
You should put up a note
in the ladies' locker room.

422
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:59,590
Put up a note?

423
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,903
"Highly classified
shit found?"

424
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:04,784
"Signals intelligence shit?
CIA shit?"

425
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:07,817
"Hello! Did anybody lose their secret CIA shit?"
I don't think so.

426
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:09,068
I don't know,
you figure it out,

427
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:10,480
but I'm not comfortable
with this,

428
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,718
and I want this
out of Hardbodies.

429
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:15,056
We're running
a gym here. God.

430
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:19,407
Manolo, you didn't find this.

431
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:21,711
I found it on
the floor there.

432
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:23,178
Yeah, I know, but...

433
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:24,331
Right there on
the floor there.

434
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:26,094
Just lying there.

435
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:52,628
Harry?

436
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,870
Yeah, it's me.

437
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:16,301
Absolut Saketini,
please.

438
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:17,422
Just a Tab.

439
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:19,055
But if I could get
an advance on my salary,

440
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:20,600
I could at least get
the surgery ball rolling.

441
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:23,064
Whoa! There's a payroll
company, you know.

442
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,885
They don't just
advance people money.

443
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,741
They just don't do that.

444
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,695
I mean, sure, I could say,
"Yes, I authorize it,"

445
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:31,215
but that's not going to
mean anything to them.

446
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:33,395
Then why do they have us on
this cockamamie health plan?

447
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:34,840
I need those surgeries, Ted.

448
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,378
You're a beautiful woman.
You don't...

449
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:38,863
I have gone just about as far
as I can go with this body.

450
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:41,011
I think
it's a beautiful...

451
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:43,251
It's not a phony-baloney
Hollywood body.

452
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:46,388
That's right, Ted.
I would be laughed out of Hollywood.

453
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:48,596
I have very limited
breasts, a ginormous ass,

454
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:49,910
and I've got this gut
that swings back and forth

455
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:52,923
in front of me like a shopping
cart with a bent wheel.

456
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:55,957
You know, there's a lot of guys
that like you just the way you are.

457
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:57,588
Yeah. Losers.

458
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:01,874
I don't know.
I mean, am I a loser? Ted.

459
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,836
You know, I wasn't always
a manager at Hardbodies.

460
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,526
Let me tell you...

461
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:10,843
Let me show you something.

462
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,939
Is that you?

463
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:23,098
Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
Congregation in Chevy Chase.

464
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:26,046
That's a good job! What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

465
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:29,565
It's a long story.

466
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:32,988
Anyway,

467
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,532
in many ways,
I'm a lot happier now.

468
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,190
My point is...

469
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,086
My point is,
it's a journey.

470
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,040
That's my point.
I don't want to stay where I am.

471
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,959
I want to find someone
to share my journey.

472
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:48,220
Well, you know, sometimes, if you
don't look in your own back yard...

473
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,840
I know. That's why I
started this Internet dating.

474
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:54,142
Uh-huh. But what I'm saying is
maybe, you know, you don't have to...

475
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:57,089
Look, Ted, I know that you can't
authorize an advance on my salary,

476
00:28:57,185 --> 00:29:00,000
but you could put in
a request, can't you?

477
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:02,743
It's not going to
do any good, Linda.

478
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:06,396
Ted, have you ever heard of
the power of positive thinking?

479
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:17,501
Harry?

480
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:20,730
It's Monica.

481
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:22,938
Well, hello.

482
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,988
Maybe I can get a run in.

483
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:43,525
<i>Hello?
- Oh, my God.</i>

484
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:49,437
Oh, my God.

485
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,693
Oh, my God.

486
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,582
Oh, my God.

487
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,895
Do you know
what time it is?

488
00:29:56,998 --> 00:29:59,169
Uh-huh. So, like,
I couldn't call you

489
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,483
on your totally
unsecure phone,

490
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,624
but I know
who the guy is.

491
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:04,869
The guy?

492
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:07,836
The guy, the secret guy.

493
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:10,338
So, is he high up?

494
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:11,715
I don't know
if he's high up.

495
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:14,434
Probably. I mean,
I got his name, not his rank.

496
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:16,194
So what's his name?

497
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:18,528
Osborne Cox.

498
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:21,127
Never heard of him.

499
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:22,948
Like you're so plugged into

500
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:23,999
the intelligence community.

501
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,021
I'm just saying
as a layperson...

502
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:28,326
I think the quality of the
intelligence dictates how high up he is.

503
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:29,832
Okay.
Not what we know.

504
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,271
I also...

505
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:34,403
Do you have any water?
I gotta hydrate.

506
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:35,650
I got tap water.

507
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:36,963
Are you kidding?

508
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:38,375
How do you know
who he is?

509
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:39,841
Sources.

510
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:41,060
What do
you mean sources?

511
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:44,293
You got like Gatorade or anything
besides, like, Maryland swamp water?

512
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:45,606
Do you know how far
this is from my place?

513
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:47,080
How do you know
his name?

514
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,902
I got this geek friend,
Eddie Gallegos.

515
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,142
He does computer stuff,
hooks up people's computers

516
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,415
and programs
their VCRs and shit.

517
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:56,931
So he examines the files and pulls off
the digital watermark, which tells you

518
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:58,345
what computer
it was created on.

519
00:30:58,507 --> 00:30:59,850
Fucking child's play
for Eddie.

520
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:00,931
Uh-huh.

521
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:02,181
And...

522
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,921
<i>I got his number, I got his number</i>

523
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,008
Oh, my God.

524
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,025
That was a bit
more difficult.

525
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,310
Shall we give him a tinkle?

526
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:11,690
Oh, my God.

527
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,638
Why?

528
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:17,123
'Cause he's gonna wanna know
that his shit is secure.

529
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:19,815
He's gonna be relieved.

530
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:23,202
He might even be so relieved
that he gives us a reward.

531
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:25,317
I would be very fucking
surprised if he did not.

532
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:27,080
Wow.
- Very surprised.

533
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:29,353
Like, you know,
the Good Samaritan tax,

534
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,749
which is not even a tax,
really, since it's voluntary.

535
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:50,058
<i>Hello?</i>

536
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:55,143
Osborne?
Osborne Cox?

537
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:56,743
<i>Yes.</i>

538
00:31:57,296 --> 00:31:58,725
<i>Who is this?</i>

539
00:32:01,232 --> 00:32:05,226
This...
Is this Osborne Cox?

540
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:08,624
<i>Who is this?
What time is it? Who are you?</i>

541
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,704
Um...

542
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,664
I'm a Good Samaritan.

543
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,505
I'm sorry I'm calling
at such an hour,

544
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,637
but I thought you
might be worried.

545
00:32:19,698 --> 00:32:20,680
<i>Worried?</i>

546
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:24,716
About the security
of your shit.

547
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,530
What on earth are
you talking about?

548
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,056
Who am I speaking to?

549
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:39,272
Your files. Your...
- The documents.

550
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:44,595
I know these documents
are sensitive.

551
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,265
But I am perfectly willing to give
back to you your sensitive shit,

552
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:52,749
you know,
at a time of your choosing.

553
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,505
<i>What documents are
you talking about?</i>

554
00:32:57,013 --> 00:32:57,961
Osborne Cox?

555
00:32:58,038 --> 00:32:59,947
<i> Yes!
Yes, this is...</i>

556
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,088
Hello, it's Osborne Cox.
Who the fuck are you?

557
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,100
<i>What documents are
you talking about?</i>

558
00:33:05,174 --> 00:33:06,189
<i>Who is that?</i>

559
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:07,472
Okay.

560
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:12,881
"The bureau chief in Belgrade
we all call Slovak the Butcher.

561
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:16,081
"He had very little rapport with
his staff and his dispatches..."

562
00:33:16,182 --> 00:33:19,216
Rapport.
"Very little rapport

563
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,590
"with his staff,"
fucking moron!

564
00:33:21,656 --> 00:33:22,932
<i>How did you get this?</i>

565
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:24,525
Don't blow a gasket,
Osborne.

566
00:33:24,664 --> 00:33:26,158
<i>Who the fuck are you?
Listen to me.</i>

567
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:28,110
We have...
It's not important where...

568
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:29,742
<i>You are in way over
your fucking head!</i>

569
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:31,245
I don't know who
the fuck you are,

570
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,742
but you have no idea
what you're doing!

571
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:37,078
Oh! Why so uptight,
Osborne Cox?

572
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:40,243
I'm just a Good Samaritan,
a traveler on the road...

573
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:41,425
Tell him we're
gonna give it back.

574
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,121
We just thought that he
would like to maybe know,

575
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:45,200
and tell him about that
Good Samaritan tax thing...

576
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:46,899
Who is that? Hello?
Ozzie, what's going on?

577
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,107
You tell him he's
inconveniencing us.

578
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:50,739
<i>Hello!
Who the fuck is this?</i>

579
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,087
<i>Ozzie,
what's going on?</i>

580
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:55,634
You know, this is a major
inconvenience for us,

581
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:58,674
and we just
thought a reward...

582
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:01,266
<i>So it's money! So it's money!</i>

583
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,615
<i>You want money?
Okay. Listen to me.</i>

584
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,090
Well, yeah, why not?

585
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:06,387
<i>Am I out of line here?
- Let me...</i>

586
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:08,596
Listen to me,
you two clowns.

587
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:10,836
Listen to me very,
very carefully.

588
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,067
You have no idea what you're doing,
and I warn you...

589
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:16,790
You warn us?
You warn us? You warn us?

590
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,550
<i>Yes. Yes. I...</i>

591
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,075
<i>Let me tell you something, Mr. Intelligence.
- Yes. Let me...</i>

592
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:22,709
<i>We warn you!
- Listen!</i>

593
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,755
We will call you back
with our demands!

594
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,877
<i>Hello? Listen to me.</i>

595
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:27,060
Chad! Don't you...

596
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,554
<i>No, Chad. Don't play his game!
- Let me explain</i>

597
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,255
<i>how this will work.
- Sorry.</i>

598
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,545
Jeez.
The nerve of that guy!

599
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:41,818
I am very fucking surprised
he did not give us that reward.

600
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:44,372
What on earth is going on?

601
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:49,236
Some clown, or two clowns, have
gotten a hold of my memoirs.

602
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,782
Your what?

603
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,854
Stolen it, or...
I don't know how...

604
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:53,941
Your what?

605
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:56,350
My memoirs, the book
that I'm writing.

606
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,797
Well, why in God's name would
anyone think that's worth anything?

607
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,322
It doesn't sound like
he's gonna play ball.

608
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,854
He'll play ball!

609
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:10,487
We just have to
show him who's boss.

610
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,121
Well, that's...

611
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,553
He sounds very senior.

612
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:16,183
I think this is
some senior guy

613
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:17,847
who has screwed
the pooch, big-time.

614
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:19,928
Yeah, that's why
we got him, you know.

615
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:22,106
We caught him with his thing
caught in a big, fat wringer.

616
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:23,736
Yeah.
And us in the driver's seat.

617
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:24,824
Uh-huh!

618
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,996
This is our opportunity.
You don't get many of these.

619
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:30,968
You slip on the ice outside of,
you know, a fancy restaurant,

620
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:32,765
or something like this happens.
- Right.

621
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:35,290
And right now
this has happened.

622
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,956
Yup.

623
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,489
It sure has.

624
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:45,091
This could put a big
dent in my surgeries.

625
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,171
Uh-huh.

626
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,221
Big time.

627
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,956
Honey! Honey!

628
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:54,843
Huh?

629
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:58,179
My car is here.
I'm off, mystery man.

630
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,411
What is that thing?

631
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,075
It's top secret, baby.

632
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:03,775
How many cities?

633
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,977
Seattle, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Chicago.

634
00:36:07,045 --> 00:36:08,736
Why do they always
send you to Seattle?

635
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:09,821
It's not a big market.

636
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:11,781
I don't know. Lots of
independent bookstores.

637
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:13,886
Rains all the time.
What else are people gonna do?

638
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,071
I can think of
a couple of things.

639
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:17,052
You can think of one thing.

640
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:18,141
Where are they
putting you?

641
00:36:18,246 --> 00:36:19,195
Christ, it better
be the Peninsula,

642
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:21,157
the money I make for them.

643
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:23,101
Are you gonna be okay?

644
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:24,483
I'll be sad,
but I'll be okay.

645
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:25,729
Not too sad.

646
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:27,076
Just the right amount.

647
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:31,587
I am crazy about you, baby.

648
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:54,306
Hey!

649
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:08,970
Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison,

650
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:12,490
Zoe Caldwell.
It was marvelous.

651
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,458
First time I've ever
attended the Kennedy Honors.

652
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:17,091
Jane Alexander
is a client,

653
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:19,302
an old friend of Zoe's.

654
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,648
Anyway...

655
00:37:22,955 --> 00:37:24,581
Connie.
- Yes, sir.

656
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:27,946
<i> Would you bring in your
copy of the Cox financials?</i>

657
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:34,567
<i>Tony sang
The Best is Yet to Come.</i>

658
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,684
<i>Tony Bennett.</i>

659
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:41,003
I thought I had it
here on a disk.

660
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,346
I don't know
where the disk is.

661
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:45,512
I'm sorry, I'll have to run
another off my hard drive.

662
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:46,826
All right. Okay.

663
00:37:46,895 --> 00:37:48,967
So we've drawn up the papers,

664
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,828
and we are prepared to execute service
on Osborne, if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.

665
00:37:54,447 --> 00:37:56,934
But since we are at
the point of no return,

666
00:37:57,071 --> 00:38:00,202
I always urge my clients
in this juncture

667
00:38:00,302 --> 00:38:04,264
to give it one more
day of reflection.

668
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,142
Harry?

669
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:39,079
It's Linda.

670
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:41,968
Well, hello.

671
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:45,550
I did the whole
bodyguard thing for years.

672
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:48,365
My guy was in State, the
Secretary as a matter of fact,

673
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:50,574
so I did a lot
of traveling.

674
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,577
"Ironside has left the building."
We called him Iron Ass.

675
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:54,764
Not to his face,
of course.

676
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,079
Not to his ass, either!

677
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:58,477
He was okay.

678
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,595
Personal protection's
a young man's game.

679
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,813
These are really good.
You wanna try one?

680
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:03,469
Yeah? Does that have
shell food in it?

681
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:05,872
Shell food?
- I got a sensitivity.

682
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:07,314
I go into
anaphylactic shock.

683
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:10,196
My larynx swells up and it closes...
What the hell.

684
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:11,855
Live dangerously, huh?

685
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:14,223
Can't always wear a condom,
right?

686
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:16,015
That's right! Not always!

687
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:20,622
Yeah. My job now is
mostly administrative.

688
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,513
Not so much PP,
personal protection.

689
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,565
I do still
carry the gun.

690
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:24,784
Oh, my God.

691
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,861
No big deal.
Never discharged it

692
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:29,039
in 20 years of service.
Security blanket now.

693
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,736
I don't even think about it.
Of course,

694
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:32,534
you're not supposed
to think about it.

695
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:35,152
In a situation where your man is
threatened, the training kicks in.

696
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:38,037
It's muscle memory.
Just like that. It's reflexes. It's...

697
00:39:38,103 --> 00:39:39,958
Those are outrageous.
You wanna swap?

698
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:41,485
No way!

699
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,217
Go away. Go away.
Let me touch.

700
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,433
Okay. Saki?

701
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:47,959
There was a hell of a lot
of political infighting

702
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:50,358
and petty, petty shit,
and then basically

703
00:39:50,424 --> 00:39:52,247
the old man stepped
on Geiberger's throat.

704
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:54,702
This is nice.
Is this wide-plank pine?

705
00:39:54,777 --> 00:39:56,435
Yeah. I guess so.

706
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,062
Yeah.

707
00:39:58,169 --> 00:40:00,625
Listen, Linda,
full disclosure here.

708
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:03,118
Yes, I am not wearing a
wedding ring, but I am married.

709
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:04,208
Hmm.

710
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:07,576
I took the ring off about 18 months
ago when we agreed to separate,

711
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:08,984
we agreed to disagree.

712
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:10,708
That's about the only
thing we ever agreed on.

713
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:14,546
Well, thanks for telling me, Harry.
I really appreciate it.

714
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:17,237
You know,
full transparency is my MO.

715
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,944
That's not gonna
go off, is it?

716
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,835
Well, let's get in the
other room and find out.

717
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:36,694
That's great.
That's exciting.

718
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,519
Yeah. He's very,
very communicative.

719
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,889
Very accessible.
He has a sense of humor,

720
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:42,844
and he agrees 100%
about my surgeries.

721
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:43,955
Well...

722
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:45,107
He agrees my ass
could be smaller.

723
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,675
I mean,
not in a mean way.

724
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,723
It comes from
a place of humor.

725
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:53,270
That's good, but, Linda, what do
you really know about this guy?

726
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:55,316
I told you, he's in
the Treasury Department.

727
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,462
But, no, I mean...

728
00:40:57,566 --> 00:41:00,565
You know, he could be one of these
guys that cruises the Internet.

729
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:02,165
Yeah, so am I.

730
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,876
What's wrong
with this?

731
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,577
No, you cannot
wear that.

732
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,824
You have to
wear a suit.

733
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:10,999
You mean,
go home and change?

734
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,532
Yeah!

735
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:15,640
I was gonna
ride my bike.

736
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:01,469
Osborne Cox.

737
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,449
And you, I take it,
are Mr. Black.

738
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,663
Yes, I am.

739
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:12,132
You have the money?

740
00:42:13,508 --> 00:42:14,915
$50,000.

741
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:19,235
That's what was agreed
upon, Osborne Cox.

742
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:24,284
All right. Let me explain
something to you, Mr. Black.

743
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,259
You know who I am,
I know who you are.

744
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,544
Perhaps,

745
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,802
but appearances
can be deceptive.

746
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,371
Yeah.

747
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:38,726
What you're engaged in is blackmail.
That is a felony.

748
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,480
That's for starters.

749
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:42,306
Appearances
can be deceptive.

750
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:45,984
I am a mere
Good Samaritan who...

751
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:49,383
Secondly, the
unauthorized dissemination

752
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:53,670
of classified material
is a federal crime.

753
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:56,256
If you ever carried out
your proposed threat,

754
00:42:56,328 --> 00:43:01,664
you would experience such a shit
storm of consequences, my friend,

755
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:04,900
that your empty little head
would be spinning

756
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:08,285
faster than the wheels of your
Schwinn bicycle back there.

757
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:09,822
You think
that's a Schwinn.

758
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:13,759
Now give me the
fucking floppy or the CD

759
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:16,005
or whatever the fuck it is...

760
00:43:16,106 --> 00:43:19,074
As soon as you give
us the money, dickwad!

761
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,986
You fuck!

762
00:43:26,122 --> 00:43:27,235
Give it to me, fuck!

763
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:30,853
You fucker.
I know who you are, fucker!

764
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,712
You're the fucker!

765
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,343
Where's the money?
- He hit me!

766
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:40,037
Where's the money?

767
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:41,828
He didn't give it to me.

768
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:43,907
For... Get in the car.
Get in the car.

769
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:56,073
What are
you doing? Shit!

770
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:03,814
Fuck it!
Fuck! Fucking lunatic!

771
00:44:05,997 --> 00:44:07,591
You fucking morons!

772
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:08,644
Dick!

773
00:44:10,158 --> 00:44:12,068
That'll give him something to think about.
- Yeah.

774
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,190
I knew this
would happen.

775
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,246
Wait. Wait!
We gotta go back!

776
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,267
My bike!

777
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:16,422
It's on to Plan B.

778
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:20,102
That's just a Kryptonite lock.
You can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!

779
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:21,934
Some people.

780
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:28,326
What is this?

781
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,479
Russian Embassy.

782
00:44:32,112 --> 00:44:34,795
I told Mr. Krapotkin
I might be stopping by.

783
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:37,551
Is there a men's room?

784
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,038
Madam,
you are mistaken.

785
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:51,079
I am assistant
cultural attaché.

786
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:54,319
The organs of state security
are not allowed to function

787
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:55,913
within the borders
of your country.

788
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,283
Organs?

789
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:00,233
Yes.

790
00:45:02,195 --> 00:45:05,773
But what if I had, say,
secrets of a highly...

791
00:45:06,515 --> 00:45:09,417
Secrets that might interest
the organs of the...

792
00:45:11,156 --> 00:45:12,170
Yes?

793
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:19,533
That's just a taste.

794
00:45:30,966 --> 00:45:32,526
May I ask the source
of this material?

795
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:33,579
No, you may not.

796
00:45:33,653 --> 00:45:35,563
He's very high up.
- Chad!

797
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:37,579
What?
I'm just saying he's high up.

798
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,716
PC or Mac?

799
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,837
PC.
PC.

800
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,527
Could you wait, please?

801
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:49,743
I do have a date.

802
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:55,627
Hey!

803
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,536
The fish has bitten.

804
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,040
Huh?

805
00:46:05,784 --> 00:46:07,411
Yeah, he seems cool.

806
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:11,310
<i>Chad.</i>

807
00:46:19,162 --> 00:46:21,397
Could you accompany me, please?

808
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:35,255
There is more material?

809
00:46:35,322 --> 00:46:36,632
There's a lot more.

810
00:46:36,763 --> 00:46:38,673
But we want to
be paid first.

811
00:46:39,995 --> 00:46:42,167
You are not ideological?

812
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,874
I don't think so.

813
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:48,336
Look, I have
a date, so...

814
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:53,171
Date.

815
00:46:55,965 --> 00:46:57,426
Uh-oh.

816
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:01,306
A line to check in, towels piling up.
I'm sorry, Ted.

817
00:47:01,436 --> 00:47:03,575
And Manolo running
around like crazy.

818
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,303
What happened to your nose?

819
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:06,902
This is not acceptable
at Hardbodies.

820
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:08,631
You two know
better than that.

821
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,262
Yes, we do, Ted.
I'm really sorry.

822
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:11,381
This is no way...

823
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,755
It was unavoidable, Ted.
It won't happen again.

824
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:14,901
But you won't tell me
what's going on.

825
00:47:14,974 --> 00:47:16,217
No, we can't.

826
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:19,387
I know this is
really terrible, Ted,

827
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:22,716
but I have to go.
I have a date.

828
00:47:25,502 --> 00:47:29,780
You're changing, Linda.
It's very sad.

829
00:47:39,584 --> 00:47:42,845
Which, to my mind, is all the more
reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.

830
00:47:43,136 --> 00:47:44,413
Mmm-hmm.

831
00:47:45,408 --> 00:47:47,099
Is that it? "Mmm-hmm"?

832
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,937
I'm wondering if it's
the right time and...

833
00:47:51,008 --> 00:47:52,383
Well, of course
it's the right time.

834
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,206
Why wouldn't it
be the right time?

835
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,127
Does this threaten you?
- No.

836
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:57,981
You and me,
we're rock solid.

837
00:47:58,177 --> 00:48:01,309
It's just, I think that's
why we can afford to be big.

838
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,027
We can think about Ozzie and
whether we give him a chance to

839
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,243
get himself together
a little bit,

840
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:06,425
before you hammer
the hell out of him.

841
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,084
Is that how you see me? Hammering him?
- Of course not...

842
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,463
No, but that was your word.
- Yeah.

843
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:13,084
I don't hammer.
- No, of course not. Listen,

844
00:48:13,442 --> 00:48:14,784
I'm no friend of the guy,
you know that.

845
00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:16,256
I think he's an
arrogant little geek.

846
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:19,649
But, you know, we have
all the time in the world,

847
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:21,023
and he just lost his job.

848
00:48:21,092 --> 00:48:22,914
He didn't lose it.
He quit.

849
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:26,046
Yeah, well, most of the people
in this town who quit, were fired.

850
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:28,223
I feel sorry for him,

851
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,475
and I think he'll be a lot easier to
deal with if he doesn't feel cornered.

852
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,582
Maybe. Just as long as we're
talking about Ozzie here, not you.

853
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:41,245
Of course we're
talking about Ozzie.

854
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:44,706
I'll do whatever you want, baby.
I adore you.

855
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:50,885
You get the check.
- Okay.

856
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:55,173
Yeah. Yes.
Is there blood in his stool?

857
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,574
Later.
I'm running home.

858
00:49:00,711 --> 00:49:01,988
I love you, baby.

859
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:12,678
Ozzie?

860
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:18,050
God damn it, Ozzie, what
have you done to the car?

861
00:49:20,744 --> 00:49:23,461
All right. All right.

862
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:41,759
Oh, my God,
am I really late?

863
00:49:41,866 --> 00:49:44,616
No, no.
It doesn't start for five minutes.

864
00:49:46,058 --> 00:49:47,433
You haven't seen
this yet, have you?

865
00:49:47,563 --> 00:49:48,970
This one, no.
No, I have not.

866
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:49,983
I hear it's terrific.

867
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:51,105
Great.

868
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:54,693
<i>We've been over
and over and over this.</i>

869
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:57,609
<i>First you say you
can't commit, and then...</i>

870
00:49:57,643 --> 00:49:59,050
<i>Would you come
down from there?</i>

871
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:10,794
Pardon our dust, the ex is
in the process of moving out.

872
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:13,227
I told her to
expedite things, but...

873
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,274
Yeah.

874
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,137
Yeah, you know, you try
to act like an adult.

875
00:50:16,206 --> 00:50:17,514
Well,
it's never easy.

876
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,662
Hmm.

877
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,767
You wanna come downstairs?
You like surprises?

878
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:24,139
Well, I'm always open
to new experiences.

879
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:27,172
I gotta tell you, I saw an ad for
this in a gentleman's magazine,

880
00:50:27,246 --> 00:50:31,020
1,200 bucks. 1,200 bucks.
I'm looking at this thing and I think,

881
00:50:31,086 --> 00:50:33,705
"Jesus, you gotta be kidding me.
I'm a hobbyist.

882
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:36,587
"This thing's basically
nothing but Speed-Rail."

883
00:50:36,655 --> 00:50:38,477
I figure I'd go down
to Home Depot

884
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:40,682
and whip this up myself
for 100 bucks.

885
00:50:41,776 --> 00:50:42,790
What is it?

886
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:43,878
What is it?

887
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,074
You sit down there,
make yourself comfortable,

888
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:51,786
put your feet in
the stirrups and...

889
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,509
Oh, my God!

890
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:04,870
That's fantastic!

891
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,538
Something, isn't it?
100 bucks all in.

892
00:51:06,642 --> 00:51:09,457
Not counting my labor
and the cost of the dildo.

893
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:11,180
Those things aren't cheap.
- Uh-huh!

894
00:51:11,282 --> 00:51:14,184
See, I lack that.
I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.

895
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,472
The Russians? The Russians?
- Uh-huh.

896
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:20,782
Mmm-hmm.

897
00:51:21,075 --> 00:51:22,668
The Russian Embassy, yeah.

898
00:51:23,442 --> 00:51:24,425
Are you sure?

899
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,499
Hey, the guy was not hard
to follow, as you know.

900
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:32,530
Why the fuck would they go to the Russians?
Why the fuck?

901
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:37,360
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Hal.

902
00:51:37,908 --> 00:51:39,731
Hey. No problemo.

903
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:45,324
Look, Ozzie, I hate to be
the paranoid old spook,

904
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:48,179
but those two guys seem
very interested in you.

905
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,778
You haven't gone poofy
on me, have you, Oz?

906
00:51:57,142 --> 00:51:58,549
Can I help you?

907
00:51:58,678 --> 00:52:00,107
I'm sorry
if I was staring,

908
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:01,775
but your face
looks familiar.

909
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:04,181
It's Princeton? '73?

910
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,261
Yeah.

911
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:06,644
I can't remember
your name.

912
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:07,888
Osborne Cox.

913
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:09,233
I thought so.

914
00:52:09,303 --> 00:52:11,278
Served and witnessed.

915
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,745
You have a real
nice evening.

916
00:52:16,408 --> 00:52:17,390
Ouch.

917
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:32,369
What the fuck?

918
00:52:38,393 --> 00:52:41,656
Fuck! What the fuck?

919
00:52:53,435 --> 00:52:55,126
Fuck! Fucking...

920
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,486
Why did you tell him
we could get more stuff?

921
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,082
Well, maybe we can.

922
00:53:04,155 --> 00:53:06,806
That's all Manolo found.
That was everything.

923
00:53:06,876 --> 00:53:08,948
What, are we
gonna tell Manolo

924
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:11,191
to scoop some more secret
spy shit off the locker floor?

925
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:12,307
Hey!
- What?

926
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:14,802
I don't like the snideness,
nor the negativity.

927
00:53:15,388 --> 00:53:17,527
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to work this thing.

928
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,353
If I'm gonna reinvent myself,
I need these surgeries,

929
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,566
and these surgeries
cost money.

930
00:53:20,637 --> 00:53:22,524
And this is not just
fun and games. I'm sorry.

931
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:24,312
So let's figure
this thing out, okay?

932
00:53:24,445 --> 00:53:26,388
<i>Chad,
your Berry Blast is ready.</i>

933
00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:28,051
We know who he is.

934
00:53:28,222 --> 00:53:29,684
Right, Osborne Cox.

935
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,212
So we can find out
where he lives, right?

936
00:53:32,285 --> 00:53:33,562
I guess.

937
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,051
You should change into a suit.
- Why?

938
00:53:36,158 --> 00:53:37,752
So you don't stand out
in his neighborhood.

939
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:38,837
There are certain
elemental things, Chad.

940
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:39,892
His neighborhood?

941
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,683
Yes. We should take out the
labels and the laundry marks.

942
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:43,994
Laundry marks?

943
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:45,500
Deniability.

944
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:50,136
<i>Shake it down</i>

945
00:53:53,952 --> 00:53:55,512
<i>Shakes right</i>

946
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,202
What's the odometer say?

947
00:56:13,131 --> 00:56:14,146
Five.

948
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:16,260
About five or approximately five?
I mean...

949
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:18,436
For fuck's sake, Harry,
it's five miles.

950
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,009
5.2.

951
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:22,181
Okay. I gotta do
at least five.

952
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:23,779
Five and a deuce is okay.

953
00:56:23,853 --> 00:56:25,739
I'm amazed you
have the energy.

954
00:56:25,803 --> 00:56:28,008
You kidding? Pull around the
corner and we'll do it in the back.

955
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:29,767
You're so coarse.

956
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:32,105
No. Back of the car,
not a rear entry situation.

957
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,508
Fuck! I'm late.

958
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,384
Hello?

959
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:32,064
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

960
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,040
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

961
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:05,823
What the fuck?

962
01:02:13,513 --> 01:02:16,711
What the fuck? Nothing?

963
01:02:18,218 --> 01:02:19,266
Oh!

964
01:02:19,338 --> 01:02:24,325
Oh, my fuck.
I killed a fucking spook.

965
01:02:26,123 --> 01:02:29,669
What the fuck are you doing
here, you fucker? You...

966
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,658
Olson, what's up?

967
01:03:03,054 --> 01:03:04,964
Palmer, what's up?

968
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:09,293
Not quite certain,
sir, but it's messy.

969
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:12,870
Kolyma Two tells us
they have computer files

970
01:03:12,942 --> 01:03:16,041
from an ex-analyst
of mine, Osborne Cox.

971
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:17,190
Kolyma Two?

972
01:03:17,264 --> 01:03:18,246
Our man in
the Russian Embassy.

973
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,214
Hmm.

974
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:21,678
They were brought in
to them by a woman...

975
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:22,857
The Russians?

976
01:03:22,895 --> 01:03:27,849
Yeah. It was brought in by
a woman named Linda Litzke,

977
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,968
an associate of a guy
named Harry Pfarrer.

978
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,006
Picture's in the file,
with Pfarrer's.

979
01:03:32,113 --> 01:03:33,487
The Russians?
- Yeah.

980
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:37,262
And who's Pfarrer?

981
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:43,500
Treasury guy who has
been screwing Mrs. Cox.

982
01:03:43,601 --> 01:03:45,194
That must be how
they got the files.

983
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:47,566
Or maybe Ozzie
knows about them.

984
01:03:47,634 --> 01:03:49,195
They all seem to be
sleeping with each other.

985
01:03:49,265 --> 01:03:50,312
All right. Spare me.

986
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:52,874
Yes, sir,
but this Treasury guy,

987
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:57,645
it's become complicated.

988
01:03:59,891 --> 01:04:03,633
He just shot somebody
in Ozzie's house.

989
01:04:04,723 --> 01:04:06,827
Shot your analyst?

990
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:08,558
No, Ozzie wasn't there.

991
01:04:08,756 --> 01:04:11,723
Our man surveilling
hears a gunshot,

992
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:13,518
sees the guy
wrestle something

993
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:15,922
into his car. Follows him.

994
01:04:15,987 --> 01:04:18,290
He dumps a body in
the Chesapeake Bay.

995
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:20,556
Well, what'd he do that for?

996
01:04:20,596 --> 01:04:21,643
Don't know, sir.

997
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:23,092
For Christ sake, did
anyone fish the body out?

998
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:24,171
Mmm-hmm.

999
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:25,553
And Russian? American?

1000
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:27,214
Don't know.
Scrubbed of ID.

1001
01:04:29,141 --> 01:04:30,385
And this Linda...

1002
01:04:30,453 --> 01:04:31,860
Linda Litzke.

1003
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:33,267
Yeah, she's Treasury?

1004
01:04:33,718 --> 01:04:34,700
No.

1005
01:04:34,806 --> 01:04:38,483
We're fuzzy on her.

1006
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:42,935
So we don't really know
what anyone is after.

1007
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:44,560
Not really, sir.

1008
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:48,343
And this analyst,
ex-analyst...

1009
01:04:48,407 --> 01:04:49,901
Cox.

1010
01:04:49,975 --> 01:04:52,430
Yeah. What's his
clearance level?

1011
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:54,161
Three.

1012
01:04:54,615 --> 01:04:56,371
Okay, no biggie.

1013
01:04:57,048 --> 01:05:00,244
Just, for now, just keep an eye
on everyone, see what they do.

1014
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:04,785
Yes, sir. And we'll interface
with the FBI on this dead body.

1015
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:07,923
No! No. God, no. We don't want
those idiots bumbling around in this.

1016
01:05:08,025 --> 01:05:09,716
Burn the body.
Get rid of it.

1017
01:05:09,816 --> 01:05:13,428
And keep an eye on
everyone, see what they do.

1018
01:05:14,169 --> 01:05:16,471
Report back to me when...

1019
01:05:18,457 --> 01:05:20,825
I don't know,
when it makes sense.

1020
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:25,392
<i>Go!</i>

1021
01:05:25,785 --> 01:05:28,568
<i>And tap. Up, up and tap!</i>

1022
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:29,746
<i>Up, up and tap.</i>

1023
01:05:29,882 --> 01:05:30,995
I'm bigger.
I'm bigger.

1024
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,659
<i>Now let's add the arms,
right here.</i>

1025
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:34,355
I'm bigger than ever.

1026
01:05:34,459 --> 01:05:36,216
<i>Up, up, again.
And again.</i>

1027
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:38,135
I'm bigger. I'm back.
I'm better. I'm back.

1028
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:40,057
<i>Than ever. I'm back.
- Let's do it again. Come on.</i>

1029
01:05:40,123 --> 01:05:41,105
You fuckers, I'm back.

1030
01:05:41,212 --> 01:05:42,226
<i>Up, up, down, down.</i>

1031
01:05:42,332 --> 01:05:43,346
You fuckers, I'm back.

1032
01:05:43,452 --> 01:05:44,434
<i>Up, up, down, down, up!</i>

1033
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,514
<i>And last time...</i>

1034
01:05:55,836 --> 01:05:57,778
Linda. You okay?

1035
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,891
Yeah, I'm fine, Ted. I'm sorry.

1036
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:01,428
You don't look fine.

1037
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:02,548
No, no, I'm...

1038
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:05,593
But you won't
tell me what's wrong.

1039
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,154
You never let me in, Linda.

1040
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:10,458
I know you're trustworthy.
I just...

1041
01:06:10,557 --> 01:06:12,859
I don't want to endanger other people.
I mean...

1042
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:16,186
This is the path that I've chosen.
It's not...

1043
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:19,483
You have to isolate,
you know, a firewall.

1044
01:06:21,214 --> 01:06:23,767
Well, I don't know
what to think.

1045
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,246
You both go AWOL on Friday.

1046
01:06:25,311 --> 01:06:27,133
And today Chad doesn't even
bother to come in at all.

1047
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:29,173
I know, Ted.
I can't run a gym this way.

1048
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,938
I know, Ted.
I'm going to have to fire him.

1049
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:32,284
No, no, no.
Ted, just...

1050
01:06:32,383 --> 01:06:33,693
What?

1051
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,166
Give me 24 hours!

1052
01:06:35,872 --> 01:06:38,783
To what?
- I don't know. Just give me 24 hours!

1053
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:41,402
Linda...
- Just give me 24 hours to solve this thing.

1054
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,048
Linda, I have to tell you.

1055
01:06:46,113 --> 01:06:48,502
A man was in here earlier,
asking about you.

1056
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:50,813
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

1057
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,474
Is Chad running away
from something?

1058
01:06:52,545 --> 01:06:54,782
We know what we're doing, Ted.
- Let me ask you this,

1059
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,792
did he know my name?

1060
01:06:57,186 --> 01:06:58,712
Well, yes, he was asking about you.

1061
01:06:58,786 --> 01:07:00,859
Employment history,
etcetera. Real jerk.

1062
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,075
I told him to get lost.

1063
01:07:02,178 --> 01:07:03,356
Thank you, Ted.

1064
01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:09,407
Well, we just don't give
that out at Hardbodies.

1065
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,164
<i>Linda, a Mr. Krapotkin on line two.</i>

1066
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:12,249
Oh, my God.

1067
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:16,891
Mr. Krapotkin?

1068
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,074
<i>This Linda?</i>

1069
01:07:18,212 --> 01:07:19,160
Yes?

1070
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,846
<i>Yes, this is Ilan Krapotkin, in the
Russian Embassy, returning your call.</i>

1071
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:25,764
Yes, yes! Hang on.
I'm sorry, Ted. This is private.

1072
01:07:32,741 --> 01:07:35,938
<i>Mr. Krapotkin? Is this a secure line?
- Yes?</i>

1073
01:07:36,005 --> 01:07:37,631
<i></i>

1074
01:07:37,733 --> 01:07:39,359
Mr. Krapotkin?
Is this a secure...

1075
01:07:39,428 --> 01:07:40,411
<i>Are you joking?</i>

1076
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:45,242
No! I'm very worried about
my associate, you know, Chad.

1077
01:07:46,534 --> 01:07:47,875
<i>Do you have him?
- Do we have him?</i>

1078
01:07:49,254 --> 01:07:51,077
Is he... Was he...
Well, I don't know what the term is.

1079
01:07:51,142 --> 01:07:52,223
Did he go over?

1080
01:07:52,326 --> 01:07:55,971
<i>I don't understand.
Is he not at Hardbodies?</i>

1081
01:07:56,391 --> 01:08:01,890
No. Look, could I come
in and discuss this?

1082
01:08:03,848 --> 01:08:05,734
<i>I'm very busy
at the moment.</i>

1083
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,815
I'm coming anyway.

1084
01:08:22,825 --> 01:08:24,735
You seem distracted.

1085
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:27,747
Do I?

1086
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:29,922
Very distracted.
The last few days.

1087
01:08:31,562 --> 01:08:33,667
Work.

1088
01:08:35,465 --> 01:08:37,221
You think that might
be enough carrots?

1089
01:08:40,107 --> 01:08:41,187
What?

1090
01:08:41,323 --> 01:08:42,403
For the salad.

1091
01:08:46,891 --> 01:08:49,476
You know, you really
are a negative person.

1092
01:08:50,956 --> 01:08:51,904
What?

1093
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:53,702
I've tried to ignore it,

1094
01:08:53,804 --> 01:08:55,463
to remain upbeat.

1095
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,703
Harry,
stop the foolishness.

1096
01:08:57,772 --> 01:08:59,976
Stop the foolishness?
- Yes, and behave.

1097
01:09:00,044 --> 01:09:03,524
You are not speaking to one
of your "shithole buddies."

1098
01:09:56,497 --> 01:09:57,577
<i>Hello?</i>

1099
01:09:58,065 --> 01:10:00,880
Honey, it's so good
to hear your voice.

1100
01:10:00,945 --> 01:10:01,993
<i>Is something wrong,
Harry?</i>

1101
01:10:02,129 --> 01:10:07,825
No. Yeah. Can you come
home? Baby needs you.

1102
01:10:08,274 --> 01:10:09,518
Can you please come home?

1103
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:12,969
<i>Harry, you know I can't
just leave the book tour.</i>

1104
01:10:13,362 --> 01:10:14,955
I can show you your present.
It's finished.

1105
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:18,475
<i>Harry, I can't just leave.
There are two days left.</i>

1106
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:20,302
<i>There's still Seattle.</i>

1107
01:10:22,387 --> 01:10:23,729
Yeah.

1108
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:25,233
<i>I love you, Harry.</i>

1109
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:29,385
Yeah. I love you, too.

1110
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:38,416
Hey! Fucker!

1111
01:10:43,317 --> 01:10:44,299
Fucker!

1112
01:10:46,261 --> 01:10:47,538
Fucker!

1113
01:10:54,197 --> 01:10:55,180
Fucker!

1114
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:57,457
Who do you
work for?

1115
01:10:57,526 --> 01:10:59,152
Who do you work for?

1116
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:06,102
Who are you?
Who are you?

1117
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:08,566
Who do you work for?
CIA? NSC?

1118
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,486
Tuchman Marsh!
- What?

1119
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:11,860
Tuchman Marsh.
- Tuchman Marsh?

1120
01:11:11,959 --> 01:11:12,941
Yes.

1121
01:11:13,048 --> 01:11:14,030
Your name is Tuchman Marsh?

1122
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,275
Tuchman Marsh
Hauptman Rodino!

1123
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:18,002
I work for them!
You work for Tuchman Marsh.

1124
01:11:18,072 --> 01:11:19,151
Yes!

1125
01:11:19,895 --> 01:11:20,943
Is that a law firm?

1126
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:23,252
No, a rock band.
Yes, it's a law firm.

1127
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,979
Well, why are you
following me?

1128
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:26,706
Divorce action,
numb nuts!

1129
01:11:30,105 --> 01:11:31,053
My wife hired you?

1130
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:33,975
No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
Tuchman Marsh hired me.

1131
01:11:34,074 --> 01:11:35,960
I work for Tuchman Marsh.

1132
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:48,375
Sandy.

1133
01:11:48,923 --> 01:11:51,639
Jesus. Grow up, man.
It happens to everybody.

1134
01:11:56,827 --> 01:11:59,193
"And at midnight
of the third day,

1135
01:11:59,259 --> 01:12:02,608
"even the sergeant
at arms fell asleep.

1136
01:12:04,092 --> 01:12:10,290
"And it was just then, at that very moment,
that Oliver sneezed."

1137
01:12:10,652 --> 01:12:11,929
Can we just...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

1138
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:14,330
You have to let the folks at
home see this illustration.

1139
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:15,738
Can we just get
a shot of that?

1140
01:12:15,869 --> 01:12:17,244
There, there it is.

1141
01:12:17,309 --> 01:12:19,480
It's Oliver interrupting
the filibuster with...

1142
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,491
That's wonderful.
It's wonderful.

1143
01:12:22,557 --> 01:12:24,662
<i>The book is Point
of Order Oliver!</i>

1144
01:12:24,766 --> 01:12:27,963
And the talented author
is Sandra Pfarrer.

1145
01:12:28,029 --> 01:12:29,556
She'll stay with us
for our next segment

1146
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:31,451
when we meet
the Sultan of Salad.

1147
01:12:31,518 --> 01:12:34,999
And then it's part two of our very
special interview with Dermot Mulroney.

1148
01:12:35,103 --> 01:12:36,510
So keep it where it is.

1149
01:12:38,622 --> 01:12:41,405
That was way out of line.
We were so unbelievably clear with them,

1150
01:12:41,502 --> 01:12:42,844
"It's just an Oliver segment."
- That's fine.

1151
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:43,859
Del and Connie
are such putzes.

1152
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:44,916
That's fine.
Thank you, we're done.

1153
01:12:44,991 --> 01:12:46,366
Well, okay, great.

1154
01:12:46,624 --> 01:12:48,827
I thought that
would never end.

1155
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:51,614
Me, too.

1156
01:12:54,528 --> 01:12:56,699
Let me get
this crap off my face.

1157
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:18,488
What the fuck?

1158
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,606
Yes, madam.
Can we help you?

1159
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:31,291
What kind of Mickey Mouse
embassy are you running, anyway?

1160
01:13:31,363 --> 01:13:32,989
I've been waiting
for 45 minutes!

1161
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,847
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
An urgent matter.

1162
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:36,803
Well, maybe this
is an urgent matter,

1163
01:13:36,868 --> 01:13:39,803
since, you know, Chad's
been missing for 48 hours.

1164
01:13:39,908 --> 01:13:43,394
I do not know the whereabouts
of Mr. Chad, madam.

1165
01:13:43,428 --> 01:13:46,462
He was gathering information
for you when he was taken.

1166
01:13:47,525 --> 01:13:51,616
We're not interested in such
information. It was dribble.

1167
01:13:52,964 --> 01:13:54,874
Dribble?

1168
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:56,961
Would you like your
disk back, madam?

1169
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:57,979
Dribble?

1170
01:13:58,886 --> 01:14:01,155
I will give you dribble.
You listen to me, Mr. Krapotkin.

1171
01:14:01,222 --> 01:14:02,367
I am a US citizen,

1172
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,510
and I will not take
this kind of treatment.

1173
01:14:09,894 --> 01:14:14,172
My check was returned
for insufficient funds.

1174
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,357
No. No, no, ma'am. No.

1175
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:19,107
There're over $40,000
in that account.

1176
01:14:19,175 --> 01:14:21,029
The account
is not overdrawn.

1177
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:23,741
When?

1178
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:27,815
But how could she
have access with...

1179
01:14:28,617 --> 01:14:30,591
What about our savings...

1180
01:14:30,664 --> 01:14:33,185
What about my
savings account?

1181
01:14:33,256 --> 01:14:34,566
Mmm-hmm.

1182
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:39,816
No. No, I'm sorry. I don't know
the number to my savings account,

1183
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:43,013
because believe it or not,
I don't spend my entire day

1184
01:14:43,113 --> 01:14:46,212
sitting around trying to
memorize the fucking numbers

1185
01:14:46,313 --> 01:14:49,412
to my fucking bank
accounts! Moron!

1186
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:06,049
No way. No, no way. Whoa!
No way, Linda. No.

1187
01:15:06,122 --> 01:15:07,399
Well, I can't do it, Ted.

1188
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:08,807
I don't know anything
about computers.

1189
01:15:08,907 --> 01:15:10,151
Linda, this whole
thing is crazy.

1190
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,456
It was crazy the first time,
and you want to do it again?

1191
01:15:12,524 --> 01:15:15,458
Break into the man's house?

1192
01:15:15,563 --> 01:15:17,668
You said the Russians
didn't even want this stuff.

1193
01:15:17,772 --> 01:15:19,179
My world is bigger
than that, Ted.

1194
01:15:19,276 --> 01:15:20,356
There are other people.

1195
01:15:20,524 --> 01:15:21,669
There are the Chinese.

1196
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:22,755
Linda,
these surgeries...

1197
01:15:22,924 --> 01:15:23,972
No. It's not about
the surgeries, Ted!

1198
01:15:24,044 --> 01:15:26,412
We can use this as
leverage to get Chad back.

1199
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,489
What do you mean
get him back?

1200
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,092
Information is power, Ted.
Hello!

1201
01:15:29,165 --> 01:15:30,244
What do you mean
get him back?

1202
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:31,332
You don't know where he is?

1203
01:15:32,941 --> 01:15:34,949
Somebody has him, Ted.
We can use this to...

1204
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:37,126
You call the police if you
wanna get back missing people.

1205
01:15:37,197 --> 01:15:38,604
I can't take it! I can't take it!
I can't take it!

1206
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,814
You know I can't do that.

1207
01:15:39,886 --> 01:15:41,577
We're operating off
the map here, Ted.

1208
01:15:41,645 --> 01:15:43,533
This is higher than the police.
It is higher than them.

1209
01:15:43,598 --> 01:15:45,573
Linda, I...
- I need a can-do person, Ted!

1210
01:15:45,647 --> 01:15:47,785
I hate your negativity!
I hate your reasons why not!

1211
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:50,318
I hate you! I hate you!

1212
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:02,380
What will it be?

1213
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:05,102
Seven and Seven.

1214
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,523
<i>Hello?
- It's Harry.</i>

1215
01:16:13,328 --> 01:16:16,526
You think a marriage is...
And then it's...

1216
01:16:20,465 --> 01:16:22,920
But this has all been
a long time coming.

1217
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:28,010
Was it? Well, yeah, right.

1218
01:16:28,242 --> 01:16:29,998
I'm just depressed.

1219
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:35,121
I gotta exercise.
I haven't run in three days.

1220
01:16:35,186 --> 01:16:36,976
Butt crunches,
anything.

1221
01:16:38,611 --> 01:16:39,952
You think maybe I could
stay here for a little while?

1222
01:16:40,051 --> 01:16:41,545
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.

1223
01:16:41,618 --> 01:16:43,658
It can't always
come from me.

1224
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:45,357
I'm not that strong!

1225
01:16:46,004 --> 01:16:47,826
You are not here
for me, Harry.

1226
01:16:48,243 --> 01:16:51,756
I need a can-do person!
You're all defeated!

1227
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:53,486
Chad is the only
can-do person I know,

1228
01:16:53,588 --> 01:16:55,531
and now he's gone. He's gone.
I'm sorry, baby.

1229
01:16:55,636 --> 01:16:57,392
I'll be good.
I'll be better.

1230
01:16:57,973 --> 01:16:59,347
I just gotta exercise.

1231
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:01,998
Do you have a pedestrian path or something?
- Who the fuck is Chad?

1232
01:17:02,069 --> 01:17:03,476
He's my friend from work.

1233
01:17:03,605 --> 01:17:05,012
You can help me find him.

1234
01:17:05,077 --> 01:17:06,091
You know law
enforcement people.

1235
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:07,243
You could make a call.

1236
01:17:07,317 --> 01:17:08,528
Unofficially.
- Linda, hold on.

1237
01:17:08,598 --> 01:17:09,645
What happened?
What's his name?

1238
01:17:09,718 --> 01:17:10,699
Chad Feldheimer.

1239
01:17:10,805 --> 01:17:13,806
And he just disappeared. He hasn't
been at work or at home for two days!

1240
01:17:13,877 --> 01:17:15,439
Okay. You know his
Social Security number?

1241
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,649
No! I...
- Okay.

1242
01:17:17,718 --> 01:17:18,766
Where was the last
place you saw him?

1243
01:17:18,838 --> 01:17:20,497
No, I don't know.
He just disappeared.

1244
01:17:20,629 --> 01:17:22,288
The Jamba Juice on K Street.

1245
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:24,050
And now he's gone.

1246
01:17:24,214 --> 01:17:25,905
No. Okay.
Now, okay, okay.

1247
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:29,138
We're gonna find your little
buddy. It's a piece of cake.

1248
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:30,221
Okay.

1249
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,742
Piece of cake. Very easy. Okay.

1250
01:17:35,191 --> 01:17:38,868
Open your mouth, open it. Do as the
doctor says. Come on, open your mouth.

1251
01:17:38,968 --> 01:17:41,783
Come on. Open your mouth.
Now look here, young man.

1252
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:45,044
You do as I say, or I'm gonna ask
your mother to leave the doctor's room,

1253
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,542
and you and I are gonna
sort it out between us.

1254
01:17:52,121 --> 01:17:56,376
Hello?
I'm with a patient.

1255
01:17:56,441 --> 01:18:00,238
And it's the same fucking patient
she's been with since yesterday?

1256
01:18:00,378 --> 01:18:03,095
You tell Dr. Cox
I have the new keys.

1257
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,557
Hey, there, sunshine.

1258
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:23,956
You seem better.

1259
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,165
Yeah, well, I snuck in a
little gym time this morning.

1260
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,730
And our exercise
last night didn't hurt.

1261
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,395
Why, Harry.

1262
01:18:29,532 --> 01:18:32,434
Boy, I tell you. I'm through
banging my head against the wall.

1263
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:34,002
I'm gonna start doing
what's right for me.

1264
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:36,149
I believe that, also. I think you
have to do what's right for you.

1265
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,010
Yeah. Hell, yeah. You know,
I had a shock recently,

1266
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:41,176
and I realized that life is not
infinite and that no one is immortal.

1267
01:18:41,309 --> 01:18:43,448
I think that it's very important
to maintain a positive attitude.

1268
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:44,827
Always up,
always ebullient.

1269
01:18:44,861 --> 01:18:46,388
Don't sweat
the small stuff.

1270
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,284
And it's all small stuff.
And it's all small stuff.

1271
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:09,270
Just for starters.

1272
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,446
Boy.

1273
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:16,566
Why, this is where we
first met, you remember?

1274
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,364
Of course I do.

1275
01:19:18,817 --> 01:19:22,363
And it's hard to know what the
important days are until you...

1276
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,392
Now, I told myself that I
wasn't going to be paranoid,

1277
01:19:26,465 --> 01:19:28,407
but is that guy
looking at us?

1278
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:32,313
No. Uh-uh.

1279
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:34,713
Have you found out
anything about Chad?

1280
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:35,766
No, nothing yet.

1281
01:19:35,874 --> 01:19:37,762
I put in a couple of calls.
It shouldn't take too long.

1282
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:38,870
Really?

1283
01:19:39,554 --> 01:19:42,336
Yeah. There are so many
databases now it's a joke.

1284
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:44,759
Back when I was in PP,
there was still an art

1285
01:19:44,802 --> 01:19:46,297
to finding people.
But not anymore.

1286
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:49,982
Now with cell phones? I mean,
pretty soon everybody's gonna know

1287
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:51,938
where you are at any given
moment, any given moment.

1288
01:19:52,035 --> 01:19:53,246
Mmm-hmm.

1289
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,002
All right.

1290
01:19:55,459 --> 01:19:57,215
When you left Jamba Juice,

1291
01:19:57,284 --> 01:19:59,935
did Chad give you any idea
where he might be going?

1292
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:02,175
I know where he was going.
- You do?

1293
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:07,459
Georgetown. Olive Street.
160 Olive Street.

1294
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:11,108
It's the residence of this guy,
Osborne Cox.

1295
01:20:19,302 --> 01:20:20,644
Who are you?

1296
01:20:23,654 --> 01:20:24,636
What?

1297
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:29,600
Who are you?
You CIA? NSA? You're military?

1298
01:20:30,502 --> 01:20:34,398
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?

1299
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:37,318
Who are you?

1300
01:20:38,631 --> 01:20:42,428
I'm just Linda Litzke.

1301
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,043
Harry!

1302
01:22:41,649 --> 01:22:43,340
For Pete's sake.

1303
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:20,308
And you are my wife's lover?

1304
01:23:20,342 --> 01:23:21,257
No.

1305
01:23:21,365 --> 01:23:22,347
Then what are
you doing here?

1306
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:28,463
I know you.
You're the guy from the gym.

1307
01:23:29,846 --> 01:23:31,569
I'm not here
representing Hardbodies.

1308
01:23:31,671 --> 01:23:35,019
Yes. I know very well
what you represent.

1309
01:23:35,446 --> 01:23:38,032
You represent
the idiocy of today.

1310
01:23:40,246 --> 01:23:41,676
I don't represent
that, either.

1311
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:43,344
Yeah.
You're the guy at the gym

1312
01:23:43,414 --> 01:23:45,389
when I asked about
that moronic woman.

1313
01:23:45,463 --> 01:23:47,668
She's not a moron.

1314
01:23:47,831 --> 01:23:50,068
You're in league
with that moronic woman.

1315
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,437
You're part of
a league of morons.

1316
01:23:52,503 --> 01:23:53,933
No. No.

1317
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:56,659
Yes. You see,
you're one of the morons

1318
01:23:56,728 --> 01:23:59,249
I've been fighting
my whole life,

1319
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:03,245
my whole fucking life.
But guess what.

1320
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,029
Today, I win.

1321
01:24:16,697 --> 01:24:17,745
Stop!

1322
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:20,631
Intruder!

1323
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:24,688
Stop! Intruder! Stop!

1324
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,585
Wait. Wait a minute.

1325
01:24:33,563 --> 01:24:36,084
Where is the Treasury guy?
- Pfarrer?

1326
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:37,944
Right now?
- Right now.

1327
01:24:38,652 --> 01:24:40,954
He is in a detention room
at Washington Dulles.

1328
01:24:41,051 --> 01:24:42,033
Why?

1329
01:24:42,171 --> 01:24:44,627
He was trying to board
a flight to Venezuela.

1330
01:24:44,796 --> 01:24:48,112
We had his name on a hot list.
CBP pulled him in.

1331
01:24:49,788 --> 01:24:52,796
Don't know why he was
trying to go to Venezuela.

1332
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:53,877
You don't know.

1333
01:24:53,981 --> 01:24:55,061
No, sir.

1334
01:24:56,029 --> 01:24:58,069
We have no extradition
with Venezuela.

1335
01:24:58,685 --> 01:24:59,733
Oh!

1336
01:25:00,764 --> 01:25:02,292
So what should
we do with him?

1337
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,340
For fuck's sake, put him on
the next flight to Venezuela.

1338
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:06,202
Yes, sir. Okay.

1339
01:25:07,006 --> 01:25:10,105
Okay. So the gym manager is dead.
- Yes, sir.

1340
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:11,188
The body is...

1341
01:25:11,263 --> 01:25:12,572
That's gone, sir.

1342
01:25:14,206 --> 01:25:15,189
Okay.

1343
01:25:15,838 --> 01:25:19,352
But there was a snag.

1344
01:25:20,191 --> 01:25:21,435
What?

1345
01:25:21,855 --> 01:25:23,066
Well,

1346
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:28,437
this analyst, Cox,
was attacking the gym guy.

1347
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,710
It was in broad daylight,
on the street.

1348
01:25:30,816 --> 01:25:33,086
Our man did not
know what to do.

1349
01:25:33,152 --> 01:25:34,329
Felt he had to step in.

1350
01:25:34,944 --> 01:25:36,121
Yes?

1351
01:25:36,736 --> 01:25:38,012
He...

1352
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:43,069
He shot the analyst.
He shot Cox.

1353
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:47,839
Good. Great.
Is he dead?

1354
01:25:47,905 --> 01:25:49,913
No, sir. He's in a coma.

1355
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:53,369
They don't think he's gonna
make it. They don't think...

1356
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:56,923
They're pretty sure that
he has no brain function.

1357
01:25:58,114 --> 01:26:02,849
Okay. Okay. If he wakes up, we'll worry
about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck.

1358
01:26:02,946 --> 01:26:05,151
So, that's it then?

1359
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:08,066
No one else really
knows anything. Okay.

1360
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,309
Um...

1361
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:11,899
Well, sir, there is...

1362
01:26:11,971 --> 01:26:13,466
What?

1363
01:26:14,276 --> 01:26:15,651
What?

1364
01:26:15,716 --> 01:26:18,236
There is the woman,
the gym woman,

1365
01:26:18,308 --> 01:26:19,518
Linda Litzke.

1366
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:22,457
Oh! Fuck, yeah.
God! Where is she?

1367
01:26:22,597 --> 01:26:24,484
We picked her up.
We have her.

1368
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:26,718
We have her?
To do what with?

1369
01:26:26,821 --> 01:26:33,018
She says she'll play ball
if we pay for some,

1370
01:26:33,157 --> 01:26:36,453
I know this sounds odd,
some surgeries

1371
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:39,517
that she wants,
cosmetic surgery.

1372
01:26:40,038 --> 01:26:42,340
She says she'll sit
on everything.

1373
01:26:42,886 --> 01:26:44,031
How much?

1374
01:26:44,101 --> 01:26:45,443
There were
several procedures.

1375
01:26:45,509 --> 01:26:46,590
Altogether they...
- Pay it.

1376
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:48,768
Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah.

1377
01:26:51,942 --> 01:26:53,252
Jesus fucking Christ!

1378
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:54,748
Yeah.

1379
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:57,987
What do we learn, Palmer?

1380
01:26:58,055 --> 01:26:59,365
I don't know, sir.

1381
01:27:00,263 --> 01:27:01,889
I don't fucking know, either.

1382
01:27:03,272 --> 01:27:05,377
I guess we learn not to do it again.
- Yes, sir.

1383
01:27:05,447 --> 01:27:07,487
I'm fucked if
I know what we did.

1384
01:27:07,624 --> 01:27:09,696
Yes, sir,
it's hard to say.

1385
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:13,510
Jesus fucking Christ.

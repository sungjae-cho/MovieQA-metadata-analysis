1
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,734
<i>Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.</i>

2
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,069
<i>Engineer, waste disposal.</i>

3
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,573
<i>File section: New employee, six days.</i>

4
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>Calling Mr. Webber...</i>

5
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,953
<i>- Come in. ...please
report to Zone A Sector 9.</i>

6
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,919
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B 1 security alert.</i>

7
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,714
<i>Stand by for ID check, please.</i>

8
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,382
Sit down.

9
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,178
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B 1 security alert.</i>

10
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,387
<i>Stand by for...</i>

11
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,805
Care if I talk?

12
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,183
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

13
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,185
Just please don't move.

14
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,979
Oh, sorry.

15
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,360
I already had an IQ test this year.
I don't think I've had one of these.

16
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,780
Reaction time is a factor, so pay attention.

17
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,532
Now answer as quickly as you can.

18
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,493
Sure.

19
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,162
1187 at Hunterwasser.

20
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,371
That's the hotel.

21
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,665
- What?
- Where I live.

22
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,542
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

23
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,377
Is that part of the test?

24
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,214
No. Just warming you up. That's all.

25
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,425
It's not fancy or anything.

26
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,137
You're in a desert, walking
along in the sand, when...

27
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,347
Is this the test, now?

28
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,016
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

29
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,935
...when you look down...
- What one?

30
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,853
- What?
- What desert?

31
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,814
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

32
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,317
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

33
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,819
Maybe you wanna be by yourself. Who knows?

34
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,113
You look down and see a tortoise.

35
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,909
- It's crawling towards you...
- Tortoise? What's that?

36
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,373
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

37
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,124
Same thing.

38
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,918
I've never seen a turtle.

39
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,047
But I understand what you mean.

40
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,925
You reach down, you flip the
tortoise over on its back.

41
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,469
Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden?

42
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,763
Or do they write them down for you?

43
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,849
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...

44
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,103
<i>...beating its legs, trying to
turn itself over, but it can't...</i>

45
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,771
...not without your help.

46
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,190
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean I'm not?

47
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,692
I mean, you're not helping.

48
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,277
Why is that, Leon?

49
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,454
They're just questions, Leon.

50
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,000
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

51
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,462
It's a test designed to
provoke an emotional response.

52
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,009
Shall we continue?

53
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,972
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

54
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,349
...about your mother.

55
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,060
- My mother?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,772
Let me tell you about my mother.

57
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,625
<i>A new life awaits you in
the Off-world colonies.</i>

58
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,878
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

59
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:46,090
<i>... in a golden land of
opportunity and adventure.</i>

60
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,162
<i>A new life awaits you in
the Off-world colonies.</i>

61
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,331
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

62
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,126
<i>... in a golden land of
opportunity and adventure.</i>

63
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,383
<i>The custom-tailored, genetically
engineered humanoid Replicant...</i>

64
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,804
<i>... designed especially for your needs.</i>

65
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,808
<i>So come on, America. Let's put out...</i>

66
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,144
Give me four.

67
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,940
No, four. Two, two. Four.

68
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,861
And noodles.

69
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,793
Hey.

70
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,720
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

71
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,139
Got the wrong guy, pal.

72
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,188
He say you Blade Runner.

73
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,815
Tell him I'm eating.

74
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,191
Captain Bryant...

75
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,405
Bryant, huh?

76
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>Yellow 3.</i>

77
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,717
<i>Climb and maintain 4000.</i>

78
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,239
<i>Final descent.</i>

79
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,367
<i>Now on glide path. Mark course.</i>

80
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,578
<i>Over the landing threshold.</i>

81
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,306
Hiya, Deck.

82
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,766
Bryant.

83
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,228
You wouldn't have come if I
just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

84
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:33,025
come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

85
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,419
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

86
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,631
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

87
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,716
<i>...so we know they're around.</i>

88
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,261
Embarrassing.

89
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:03,973
No, sir, not embarrassing. No one's
ever gonna find out they're down here.

90
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,684
Because you're gonna spot
them and air them out.

91
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,143
I don't work here anymore.

92
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,563
Give it to Holden.

93
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,065
- He's good.
- I did.

94
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,734
He can breathe okay as
long as nobody unplugs him.

95
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,822
He's not good enough. Not good as you.

96
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,574
I need you, Deck.

97
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,118
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

98
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,871
I need the old Blade Runner.

99
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,622
I need your magic.

100
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,835
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

101
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,546
I'm twice as quit now.

102
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,591
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

103
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,552
If you're not cop, you're little people.

104
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,065
No choice, huh?

105
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,485
No choice, pal.

106
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,947
<i>I already had an IQ test this year.</i>

107
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,199
<i>I don 't think I've ever had one of these.</i>

108
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,869
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

109
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,121
<i>- Answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.</i>

110
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,291
<i>1187 at Hunterwasser.</i>

111
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,876
<i>Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

112
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,295
<i>- What?
- Where I live.</i>

113
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,714
<i>- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

114
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,884
There was an escape from the
Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

115
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,511
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

116
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,181
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

117
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,642
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

118
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,602
No crew, no sight of them.

119
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,688
Three nights ago they tried to
break into Tyrell Corporation.

120
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,441
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

121
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,526
We lost the others.

122
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,156
On the possibility they might
try to infiltrate as employees...

123
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,535
...I had Holden go over and run Voight
- Kampff tests on the new workers.

124
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,496
Looks like he got himself one.

125
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:54,249
<i>So you look down and you see a
tortoise. It's crawling towards you.</i>

126
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,626
<i>- Tortoise?
- That's Leon.</i>

127
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,961
Ammunition loader on intergalactic runs.

128
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,215
He can lift 400-pound atomic
loads all day and night.

129
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,759
The only way you can hurt him is to kill him.

130
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:08,347
<i>I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?</i>

131
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,266
What do they want out of
the Tyrell Corporation?

132
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,228
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

133
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,159
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

134
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,286
Incept date: 2016.

135
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,206
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

136
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,501
Probably the leader.

137
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,548
This is Zhora.

138
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:45,175
She's trained for an
Off-world kick murder squad.

139
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,847
Talk about Beauty and the Beast. She's both.

140
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,855
The fourth skin-job is
Pris, a basic pleasure model.

141
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:00,858
The standard item for military
clubs in the outer colonies.

142
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,864
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

143
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,116
The designers reckoned after a few years...

144
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,785
...they might develop their
own emotional responses.

145
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,372
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

146
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,749
So they built in a fail-safe device.

147
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,253
- Which is what? -
Four-year lifespan.

148
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:30,929
Now, there's a Nexus 6 over
at the Tyrell Corporation.

149
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,309
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

150
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,984
Do you like our owl?

151
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,240
It's artificial?

152
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,201
Of course it is.

153
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:18,870
Must be expensive.

154
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,583
Very. I'm Rachael.

155
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,544
Deckard.

156
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:32,092
It seems you feel our work is
not a benefit to the public.

157
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:37,222
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

158
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,142
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

159
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:43,145
May I ask you a personal question?

160
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,523
Sure.

161
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,904
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

162
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,283
No.

163
00:17:56,449 --> 00:18:00,245
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

164
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,125
Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response?

165
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,004
Fluctuation of the pupil.

166
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,008
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

167
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,344
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

168
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,639
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

169
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,517
Demonstrate it.

170
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:24,686
I wanna see it work.

171
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,480
- Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

172
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,567
I wanna see a negative before
I provide you with a positive.

173
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,444
What's that gonna prove?

174
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,405
Indulge me.

175
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,115
On you?

176
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,575
Try her.

177
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,207
It's too bright in here.

178
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:24,829
Do you mind if I smoke?

179
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,666
It won't affect the test.

180
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:33,004
All right, I'm gonna ask
you a series of questions.

181
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:36,591
Just relax and answer
them as simply as you can.

182
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,310
It's your birthday. Someone
gives you a calfskin wallet.

183
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,312
I wouldn't accept it.

184
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,900
Also, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

185
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:58,321
You've got a little boy. He shows
you his butterfly collection...

186
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,323
...plus the killing jar.

187
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,370
I'd take him to the doctor.

188
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,752
You're watching television.

189
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,630
Suddenly you realize there's
a wasp crawling on your arm.

190
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,007
I'd kill it.

191
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:24,556
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

192
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:27,892
Is this testing whether I'm a
Replicant or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

193
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,353
Just answer the questions, please.

194
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,443
You show it to your husband.

195
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,154
He likes it so much he hangs
it on your bedroom wall.

196
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,780
- bush outside your window?

197
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:42,282
I wouldn't let him.

198
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,908
- orange body, green legs?

199
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,410
Why not?

200
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,704
I should be enough for him.

201
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,460
One more question.

202
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:57,297
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

203
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,593
The guests are enjoying an
appetizer of raw oysters.

204
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,846
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

205
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:24,032
Would you step out for
a few moments, Rachael?

206
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,335
Thank you.

207
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,963
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

208
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm impressed.

209
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,718
How many questions does it
usually take to spot one?

210
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,596
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

211
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,474
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

212
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:52,185
It took more than a hundred
for Rachael, didn't it?

213
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,187
She doesn't know.

214
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,147
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

215
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,399
Suspect? How can it not know what it is?

216
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:01,736
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

217
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,155
"More human than human" is our motto.

218
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:07,992
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

219
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,580
We began to recognize in
them a strange obsession.

220
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:16,167
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...

221
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:19,837
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

222
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:25,510
If we gift them with a past, we create a
cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

223
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,471
...then consequently we
can control them better.

224
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,473
Memories.

225
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,600
You're talking about memories.

226
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,405
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

227
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,532
<i>- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.</i>

228
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,326
<i>- 1187 at Hunterwasser.
- Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

229
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:51,703
<i>- What?
- Where I live.</i>

230
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,496
<i>- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

231
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,498
<i>- Is that part of the test?
- No.</i>

232
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,197
Kowalski.

233
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:17,723
Time...

234
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,100
...enough.

235
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,121
Did you get your precious photos?

236
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,126
Someone was there.

237
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:47,545
Men?

238
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:54,635
Policemen?

239
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:30,022
<i>Fiery the angels fell</i>

240
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:33,442
<i>Deep thunder rolled around their shores</i>

241
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:37,196
<i>Burning with the fires of Orc</i>

242
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,452
You not come here! Illegal!

243
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,998
Hey! Hey!

244
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,544
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

245
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,807
Yes.

246
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,517
Questions.

247
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,693
Hey! Hey!

248
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:33,294
Morphology. Longevity. Incept dates.

249
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,962
Don't know.

250
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,423
I don't know such stuff.

251
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,260
I just do eyes.

252
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:44,263
Just eyes, just genetic design.

253
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,265
Just eyes.

254
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:50,394
You Nexus, huh?

255
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:53,147
I design your eyes.

256
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:55,315
Chew...

257
00:28:55,482 --> 00:29:00,571
...if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

258
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,656
Now...

259
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:04,658
...questions.

260
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:06,910
I don't know answers.

261
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:08,912
Who does?

262
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:13,792
Tyrell.

263
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,335
He knows everything.

264
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:19,590
Tyrell Corporation?

265
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:23,802
He big boss. Big genius. He design your mind.

266
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:25,846
Your brain, huh?

267
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:28,724
Smart.

268
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,686
Very cold.

269
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:38,442
Not an easy man to see...

270
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:41,695
Give me coat.

271
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,198
...I guess?

272
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:51,497
Sebastian.

273
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:55,501
He take you there. He take you there.

274
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,212
Sebastian who?

275
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,509
J.F...

276
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,637
...Sebast...

277
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,057
Now...

278
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,561
...where...

279
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:17,815
...would we find this...

280
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:21,360
...J.F. Sebastian?

281
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,238
<i>Let's continue, shall we?</i>

282
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:26,490
<i>Describe in single words...</i>

283
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:30,327
<i>... only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother.</i>

284
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:32,621
<i>- My mother?
- Yeah.</i>

285
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,373
<i>I'll tell you about my mother.</i>

286
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:59,565
<i>Voice print identification.
Your floor number, please.</i>

287
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:03,986
<i>- Deckard, 97.
- 97. Thank you. Danke.</i>

288
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:27,050
I wanted to see you.

289
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:34,141
So I waited.

290
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:36,310
Let me help you.

291
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:41,648
What do I need help for?

292
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:45,819
I don't know why he told you what he did.

293
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:47,070
Talk to him.

294
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:49,865
He wouldn't see me.

295
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:04,046
You want a drink?

296
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,175
No?

297
00:32:14,347 --> 00:32:16,933
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

298
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:24,232
Look.

299
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:27,778
It's me with my mother.

300
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,405
Yeah?

301
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:39,206
Remember when you were 6?

302
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:43,043
You and your brother snuck into an
empty building through a basement window.

303
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,545
You were gonna play doctor?

304
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:50,050
He showed you his, and when it got to
be your turn, you chickened and ran.

305
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:51,885
Remember that?

306
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:58,475
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

307
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:03,855
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

308
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:07,025
Orange body, green legs?

309
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:09,945
Watched her build a web all summer?

310
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:12,531
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

311
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:14,407
The egg hatched...

312
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:17,118
- The egg hatched...
- And?

313
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:20,497
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

314
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:23,041
And they ate her.

315
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,631
Implants.

316
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:32,551
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

317
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:35,178
They're Tyrell's niece's.

318
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:44,855
Okay.

319
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:46,606
Bad joke.

320
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:48,358
I made a bad joke.

321
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,193
You're not a Replicant.

322
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,403
Go home.

323
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,238
Okay?

324
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:58,493
No, really. I'm sorry.

325
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:00,787
Go home.

326
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,884
Want a drink?

327
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:19,014
I'll get you a drink.

328
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,516
I'll get a glass.

329
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:07,116
Hey!

330
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:14,499
You forgot your bag.

331
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,969
I'm lost.

332
00:38:28,346 --> 00:38:30,306
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

333
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:35,686
What's your name?

334
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:39,190
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

335
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:41,401
- Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:46,823
Oh, where were you going?

337
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:50,409
Home?

338
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:53,621
I don't have one.

339
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,293
We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?

340
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,254
We sure did.

341
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:09,053
I'm hungry, J.F.

342
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:11,889
I got stuff inside.

343
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:13,766
You wanna come in?

344
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:16,269
I was hoping you'd say that.

345
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:52,597
Do you live in this building all by yourself?

346
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:55,933
Yeah, I live here pretty
much alone right now.

347
00:39:56,475 --> 00:39:59,103
No housing shortage around here.

348
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:03,691
Plenty of room for everybody.

349
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,036
Watch out for the water.

350
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:19,874
Must get Ionely here, J.F.

351
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:24,629
Not really. I make friends.

352
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:28,174
They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them.

353
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,676
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

354
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:32,720
Do you know what that is?

355
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:34,472
No.

356
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:37,933
Now.

357
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:45,399
Yoo-hoo, home again.

358
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:53,199
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

359
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:56,452
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

360
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:10,633
They're my friends. I made them.

361
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,635
Where are your folks?

362
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,303
I'm sort of an orphan.

363
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:16,681
What about your friends?

364
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:19,308
I have some, but I have to find them.

365
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:22,061
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

366
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,194
Can I take those things for
you? They're soaked, aren't they?

367
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:12,004
Enhance 224 to 176.

368
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:31,065
Enhance.

369
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:32,691
Stop.

370
00:43:46,455 --> 00:43:48,290
Move in.

371
00:43:48,457 --> 00:43:50,084
Stop.

372
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,544
Pull out, track right.

373
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:54,505
Stop.

374
00:43:55,756 --> 00:43:58,175
Center and pull back.

375
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:02,179
Stop.

376
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:05,057
Track 45 right.

377
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,227
Stop.

378
00:44:08,394 --> 00:44:10,187
Center and stop.

379
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:19,154
Enhance 34 to 36.

380
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:31,375
Pan right and pull back.

381
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:33,794
Stop.

382
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:40,968
Enhance 34 to 46.

383
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,982
Pull back.

384
00:44:55,357 --> 00:44:57,025
Wait a minute. Go right.

385
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:00,112
Stop.

386
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:01,947
Enhance 57-19.

387
00:45:04,408 --> 00:45:06,869
Track 45 left.

388
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:10,372
Stop.

389
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,793
Enhance 15 to 23.

390
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,056
Give me a hard copy right there.

391
00:46:24,821 --> 00:46:26,406
Fish?

392
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:44,758
I think it was manufactured locally.

393
00:46:49,346 --> 00:46:54,017
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

394
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:57,104
There is the maker's serial number.

395
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:03,819
9906947-XB71.

396
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:05,904
Interesting.

397
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,951
Not fish. Snake scale.

398
00:47:11,118 --> 00:47:12,536
Snake.

399
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:17,374
Try Abdul Ben Hassan. He make this snake!

400
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,812
Abdul Hassan?

401
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:25,233
I'm a police officer. I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

402
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,487
Artificial snake license XB71, that's you?

403
00:48:29,488 --> 00:48:32,324
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

404
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:35,202
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

405
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:36,495
How many?

406
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:38,872
- Very few.
- How few?

407
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:40,707
- Look, my friend...
- Taffey Lewis'.

408
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:44,336
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

409
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:49,674
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

410
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:54,304
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

411
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:57,515
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

412
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,666
Bartender.

413
00:49:26,253 --> 00:49:28,171
Taffey Lewis?

414
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:30,465
Thank you.

415
00:49:33,468 --> 00:49:35,345
- Taffey?
- Yeah?

416
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:38,223
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

417
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,183
Blow.

418
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:44,187
You ever buy snakes from
the Egyptian, Taffey?

419
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:45,772
All the time, pal.

420
00:49:48,608 --> 00:49:49,943
You ever see this girl, huh?

421
00:49:51,444 --> 00:49:52,946
Never seen her. Buzz off.

422
00:49:53,113 --> 00:49:54,948
Your licenses in order, pal?

423
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,242
Hey, Louie.

424
00:49:57,409 --> 00:50:01,997
The man is dry. Give him
one on the house, okay? See?

425
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,040
Hello?

426
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:51,546
I've had people walk out on
me before, but not when...

427
00:50:51,713 --> 00:50:53,923
...I was being so charming.

428
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:58,136
I'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

429
00:50:59,262 --> 00:51:00,680
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

430
00:51:00,847 --> 00:51:04,058
Why don't you come on
down here and have a drink?

431
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:06,770
<i>I don 't think so, Mr. Deckard.</i>

432
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:09,314
<i>That's not my kind of place.</i>

433
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:11,024
Go someplace else?

434
00:51:26,956 --> 00:51:29,501
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

435
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:34,923
<i>... Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.</i>

436
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:39,469
<i>Watch her take the
pleasure from the serpent...</i>

437
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:43,389
<i>... that once corrupted man.</i>

438
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,351
Excuse me, Miss Salome, can
I talk to you for a minute?

439
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:32,647
I'm from the American
Federation of Variety Artists.

440
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:33,856
Oh, yeah?

441
00:52:34,023 --> 00:52:37,819
I'm not here to make you join. No,
ma'am. That's not my department.

442
00:52:37,986 --> 00:52:39,862
Actually...

443
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:46,452
<i>...I'm from the confidential
committee on Moral Abuses.</i>

444
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:49,247
Committee of Moral Abuses?

445
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:51,582
There's been reports that the management...

446
00:52:51,749 --> 00:52:53,918
...has been taking
liberties with the artists.

447
00:52:54,085 --> 00:52:55,545
I don't know nothing about it.

448
00:52:55,712 --> 00:52:58,715
Have you felt yourself to
be exploited in any way?

449
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:01,342
How do you mean "exploited"?

450
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:04,053
Well, like to get this job.

451
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,142
<i>I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...</i>

452
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:11,519
...lewd or unsavory or...

453
00:53:11,686 --> 00:53:15,565
...otherwise repulsive to your person, huh?

454
00:53:18,276 --> 00:53:21,154
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,574
I'd like to check your
dressing room, if I may.

456
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:27,452
- For what?
- For holes.

457
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:28,661
Holes?

458
00:53:28,828 --> 00:53:31,622
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

459
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:34,625
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

460
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:38,921
No, I wouldn't.

461
00:53:39,088 --> 00:53:41,215
Little...

462
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:46,846
...dirty holes they drill in the
wall so they can watch a lady undress.

463
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:23,549
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

464
00:54:23,716 --> 00:54:27,845
Think I'd be working in a place like
this if I could afford a real snake?

465
00:54:41,943 --> 00:54:44,946
So if somebody does try to exploit
me, who do I go to about it?

466
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:49,283
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

467
00:55:15,685 --> 00:55:17,478
The only thing they care about...

468
00:55:17,645 --> 00:55:18,813
Hey!

469
00:56:45,566 --> 00:56:48,277
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

470
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:51,614
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

471
00:56:51,781 --> 00:56:54,492
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

472
00:56:54,658 --> 00:56:57,578
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

473
00:56:57,745 --> 00:57:01,082
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

474
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:03,876
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

475
00:57:04,043 --> 00:57:06,170
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

476
00:57:06,337 --> 00:57:09,381
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

477
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:27,149
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

478
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:30,319
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

479
00:57:30,486 --> 00:57:32,738
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

480
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:36,450
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

481
00:57:36,617 --> 00:57:38,202
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

482
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:40,204
Move! Get out of the way!

483
00:59:26,518 --> 00:59:28,103
Deckard.

484
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,855
B26354.

485
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:39,114
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

486
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:41,533
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

487
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,912
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

488
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,294
A minute.

489
00:59:54,546 --> 00:59:56,090
Yeah, what do you want?

490
00:59:56,256 --> 00:59:58,050
Tsingtao.

491
01:00:05,224 --> 01:00:07,142
This enough?

492
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:08,811
Yeah.

493
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:19,321
Bryant.

494
01:00:39,216 --> 01:00:43,178
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

495
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:44,596
I'm going home.

496
01:00:44,763 --> 01:00:46,682
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

497
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:49,643
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

498
01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:52,187
Four more to go.

499
01:00:52,354 --> 01:00:54,106
- come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

500
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,568
There's three to go.

501
01:00:58,193 --> 01:01:00,445
There's four.

502
01:01:00,612 --> 01:01:03,448
That skin-job you vK'd at
the Tyrell Corporation...

503
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:07,494
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

504
01:01:07,661 --> 01:01:10,539
Something to do with a
brain implant, says Tyrell.

505
01:01:10,706 --> 01:01:14,042
Come on, Gaff. Drink some for me, huh, pal?

506
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,713
Leon.

507
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,590
How old am I?

508
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:07,596
I don't know.

509
01:02:09,848 --> 01:02:13,101
My birthday's April 10,
2017. How long do I live?

510
01:02:13,268 --> 01:02:15,062
Four years.

511
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:23,320
More than you.

512
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:31,078
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

513
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:39,878
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

514
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:42,255
I agree.

515
01:02:53,392 --> 01:02:55,352
Wake up. Time to die.

516
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,347
Shakes?

517
01:03:33,932 --> 01:03:35,517
Me too.

518
01:03:39,479 --> 01:03:41,398
I get them bad.

519
01:03:46,987 --> 01:03:49,156
It's part of the business.

520
01:03:56,413 --> 01:03:57,789
I'm not in the business.

521
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:13,555
I am the business.

522
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:47,732
What if I go north?

523
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,862
Disappear.

524
01:05:58,284 --> 01:05:59,619
Would you come after me?

525
01:06:01,746 --> 01:06:03,456
Hunt me?

526
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:09,838
No.

527
01:06:12,507 --> 01:06:14,509
No, I wouldn't.

528
01:06:20,265 --> 01:06:21,433
I owe you one.

529
01:06:36,698 --> 01:06:38,950
But somebody would.

530
01:06:51,296 --> 01:06:53,214
Deckard...

531
01:06:55,675 --> 01:06:57,844
...you know those files on me?

532
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:02,807
The incept date. The longevity.

533
01:07:02,974 --> 01:07:04,893
Those things.

534
01:07:06,227 --> 01:07:08,062
You saw them?

535
01:07:11,482 --> 01:07:13,234
<i>They're...</i>

536
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:14,611
...classified.

537
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:17,280
But you're a policeman.

538
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:19,532
I...

539
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:21,659
...didn't look at them.

540
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:25,997
You know, that Voight-Kampff
test of yours...

541
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:30,001
...did you ever take that test yourself?

542
01:07:41,763 --> 01:07:43,556
Deckard.

543
01:10:13,831 --> 01:10:15,583
I dreamt music.

544
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:23,382
I didn't know if I could play.

545
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:27,803
I remember lessons.

546
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:32,642
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

547
01:10:37,271 --> 01:10:39,565
You play beautifully.

548
01:11:49,635 --> 01:11:52,096
Now you kiss me.

549
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:54,974
I can't rely on my...

550
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:57,768
Say, "Kiss me."

551
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:02,398
Kiss me.

552
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,786
I want you.

553
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:20,416
I want you.

554
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,168
Again.

555
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:24,211
I want you.

556
01:12:27,381 --> 01:12:29,800
Put your hands on me.

557
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:54,927
- What you doing?
- I'm sorry. Just peeking.

558
01:13:58,806 --> 01:14:01,934
- How do I look?
- You look better.

559
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:05,145
- Just better?
- Well...

560
01:14:05,312 --> 01:14:06,563
...you look beautiful.

561
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:11,860
Thanks.

562
01:14:18,283 --> 01:14:20,202
How old are you?

563
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:24,164
Twenty-five.

564
01:14:24,331 --> 01:14:27,251
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

565
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:28,752
What's that?

566
01:14:28,919 --> 01:14:31,922
My glands, they grow old too fast.

567
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:37,344
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

568
01:14:40,347 --> 01:14:41,557
Anyway...

569
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:43,183
...I kind of like it here.

570
01:14:45,853 --> 01:14:47,813
I like you...

571
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,231
...just the way you are.

572
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:54,278
Hi, Roy.

573
01:14:54,445 --> 01:14:55,863
Hi.

574
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,740
Gosh, you...

575
01:14:57,906 --> 01:15:00,200
...really got some nice toys here.

576
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:02,745
This is the friend I was telling you about.

577
01:15:02,911 --> 01:15:06,123
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

578
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:07,791
Sebastian.

579
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:11,170
I like a man that stays put.

580
01:15:12,713 --> 01:15:16,049
You live here all by yourself, do you?

581
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:17,259
Yes.

582
01:15:28,812 --> 01:15:31,190
How about some breakfast?

583
01:15:31,356 --> 01:15:33,317
I was just gonna make some.

584
01:15:33,484 --> 01:15:34,526
Excuse me.

585
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:43,535
Well?

586
01:15:45,788 --> 01:15:47,039
Leon...

587
01:15:47,206 --> 01:15:49,208
What's going on?

588
01:15:53,504 --> 01:15:55,214
There's only two of us now.

589
01:15:57,424 --> 01:16:00,511
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

590
01:16:04,556 --> 01:16:06,767
No, we won't.

591
01:16:40,259 --> 01:16:41,301
No.

592
01:16:41,468 --> 01:16:43,971
Knight takes queen, see?

593
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:46,056
Won't do.

594
01:16:54,398 --> 01:16:56,525
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

595
01:16:56,692 --> 01:16:58,068
Because...

596
01:16:58,235 --> 01:17:00,404
...you're so different.

597
01:17:01,947 --> 01:17:04,032
You're so perfect.

598
01:17:06,535 --> 01:17:08,787
Yes.

599
01:17:08,954 --> 01:17:11,081
What generation are you?

600
01:17:19,214 --> 01:17:20,424
Nexus 6.

601
01:17:21,466 --> 01:17:22,843
I knew it.

602
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:26,263
Because I do genetic design
work for the Tyrell Corporation.

603
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,640
There's some of me in you.

604
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:31,476
Show me something.

605
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:33,395
Like what?

606
01:17:33,562 --> 01:17:35,480
Like anything.

607
01:17:37,316 --> 01:17:42,112
We're no computers,
Sebastian. We're physical.

608
01:17:43,905 --> 01:17:46,158
I think, Sebastian...

609
01:17:46,324 --> 01:17:48,744
...therefore, I am.

610
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:52,205
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

611
01:18:19,107 --> 01:18:20,859
We've got a lot in common.

612
01:18:21,026 --> 01:18:23,278
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

613
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:26,239
Accelerated decrepitude.

614
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:30,911
I don't know much about
bio-mechanics, Roy. I wish I did.

615
01:18:32,996 --> 01:18:35,499
<i>If we don't find help soon...</i>

616
01:18:35,665 --> 01:18:38,585
<i>...Pris hasn't got long to live.</i>

617
01:18:38,752 --> 01:18:40,504
We can't allow that.

618
01:18:42,714 --> 01:18:45,926
- Is he good?
- Who?

619
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:49,471
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

620
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:53,099
I've only beaten him once
in chess. He's a genius.

621
01:18:55,352 --> 01:18:56,394
He designed you.

622
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:01,399
Maybe he could help.

623
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:04,110
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

624
01:19:06,196 --> 01:19:09,699
Better if I talk to him in person.

625
01:19:12,828 --> 01:19:17,874
But I understand he's a
sort of hard man to get to.

626
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:20,001
Yes.

627
01:19:20,168 --> 01:19:21,795
Very.

628
01:19:24,714 --> 01:19:27,133
Will you help us?

629
01:19:27,842 --> 01:19:29,177
I can't.

630
01:19:29,344 --> 01:19:31,346
We need you, Sebastian.

631
01:19:31,513 --> 01:19:34,391
You're our best and only friend.

632
01:19:47,404 --> 01:19:49,864
We're so happy you found us.

633
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,785
<i>I don't think there's another human being...</i>

634
01:19:53,952 --> 01:19:56,246
...in the whole world who would've helped us.

635
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:48,798
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.

636
01:20:49,966 --> 01:20:51,426
Trade.

637
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:54,346
<i>- Trade at two...
- Blue entry.</i>

638
01:20:55,347 --> 01:20:58,725
<i>A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.</i>

639
01:20:58,892 --> 01:21:02,979
<i>16417.</i>

640
01:21:03,772 --> 01:21:05,523
<i>At this hour?</i>

641
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:08,860
<i>What can I do for you, Sebastian?</i>

642
01:21:11,988 --> 01:21:13,490
Queen to bishop six. Check.

643
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,289
Nonsense.

644
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:23,708
Just a moment.

645
01:21:26,628 --> 01:21:31,341
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

646
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:38,723
Queen...

647
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,393
...bishop six.

648
01:21:47,482 --> 01:21:49,859
<i>Knight...</i>

649
01:21:50,026 --> 01:21:52,278
<i>... takes queen.</i>

650
01:21:59,118 --> 01:22:01,496
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

651
01:22:01,663 --> 01:22:03,122
What are you thinking about?

652
01:22:04,749 --> 01:22:06,960
Bishop to king seven.

653
01:22:07,126 --> 01:22:09,170
Checkmate.

654
01:22:09,337 --> 01:22:11,381
Bishop to king seven. Checkmate, I think.

655
01:22:13,216 --> 01:22:16,469
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

656
01:22:16,636 --> 01:22:19,556
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

657
01:22:19,722 --> 01:22:21,891
<i>Let's discuss this.</i>

658
01:22:22,058 --> 01:22:24,060
<i>You better come up, Sebastian.</i>

659
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:43,663
Mr. Tyrell?

660
01:22:45,415 --> 01:22:47,125
I...

661
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:49,210
I brought a friend.

662
01:22:55,466 --> 01:22:59,470
I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

663
01:23:06,144 --> 01:23:09,272
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

664
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:12,942
And what can he do for you?

665
01:23:13,693 --> 01:23:17,196
Can the maker repair what he makes?

666
01:23:17,363 --> 01:23:20,700
Would you like to be modified?

667
01:23:20,867 --> 01:23:22,827
Stay here.

668
01:23:27,957 --> 01:23:31,377
Had in mind something a little more radical.

669
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:33,963
What...?

670
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:36,632
What seems to be the problem?

671
01:23:36,966 --> 01:23:39,594
- Death.
- Death.

672
01:23:40,261 --> 01:23:43,348
Well, I'm afraid that's a little
out of my jurisdiction. You...

673
01:23:43,514 --> 01:23:46,476
I want more life...

674
01:23:46,642 --> 01:23:47,935
...father.

675
01:23:52,815 --> 01:23:54,984
The facts of life.

676
01:23:56,402 --> 01:23:59,197
To make an alteration in the...

677
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:01,783
...evolvement of an organic
life system is fatal.

678
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:05,536
A coding sequence cannot be
revised once it's been established.

679
01:24:05,703 --> 01:24:06,746
Why not?

680
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:08,915
Because by the second day of incubation...

681
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:13,586
...any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations...

682
01:24:13,753 --> 01:24:18,007
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

683
01:24:18,174 --> 01:24:19,967
Then the ship sinks.

684
01:24:20,134 --> 01:24:23,679
What about EMS recombination?

685
01:24:23,846 --> 01:24:25,389
We've already tried it.

686
01:24:25,556 --> 01:24:29,852
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

687
01:24:30,019 --> 01:24:34,148
It created a virus so lethal the...

688
01:24:34,315 --> 01:24:36,484
...subject was dead before he left the table.

689
01:24:36,651 --> 01:24:39,737
Then a repressor protein that
blocks the operating cells.

690
01:24:39,904 --> 01:24:43,866
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

691
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:48,746
So that the newly formed DNA
strand carries a mutation...

692
01:24:48,913 --> 01:24:51,791
<i>...and you've got a virus again.</i>

693
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:56,420
But this, all of this, is...

694
01:24:56,587 --> 01:24:58,172
...academic.

695
01:24:58,339 --> 01:25:00,842
You were made as well as we could make you.

696
01:25:01,008 --> 01:25:02,760
But not to last.

697
01:25:03,553 --> 01:25:06,764
The light that burns twice
as bright burns half as long.

698
01:25:06,931 --> 01:25:11,144
And you have burned so
very, very brightly, Roy.

699
01:25:11,769 --> 01:25:13,521
Look at you.

700
01:25:13,688 --> 01:25:16,232
You're the prodigal son.

701
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:19,944
You're quite a prize.

702
01:25:25,575 --> 01:25:27,118
<i>I've done...</i>

703
01:25:27,285 --> 01:25:28,911
...questionable things.

704
01:25:29,078 --> 01:25:30,997
Also extraordinary things.

705
01:25:31,581 --> 01:25:34,000
Revel in your time.

706
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,466
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

707
01:26:34,685 --> 01:26:37,438
Sorry, Sebastian.

708
01:26:37,813 --> 01:26:40,775
Come. Come.

709
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:32,034
<i>Body identified with Tyrell is
a 25-year-old male Caucasian.</i>

710
01:27:32,201 --> 01:27:35,037
<i>Name: Sebastian, J.F. Sebastian.</i>

711
01:27:35,204 --> 01:27:40,084
<i>Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, NF46751.</i>

712
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:41,877
<i>I want you to go down there and...</i>

713
01:27:45,923 --> 01:27:48,926
<i>This sector's closed to ground
traffic. What're you doing here?</i>

714
01:27:49,093 --> 01:27:52,805
<i>- I'm working. What are you doing?
- Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.</i>

715
01:27:52,972 --> 01:27:57,685
I'm Deckard, Blade Runner.
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

716
01:27:57,852 --> 01:27:59,103
<i>Hold on. Checking.</i>

717
01:28:03,274 --> 01:28:06,986
<i>Okay. Checked and cleared. Have a better one.</i>

718
01:28:17,538 --> 01:28:19,540
<i>- Hello.
- Hi. Is J.F. there?</i>

719
01:28:19,707 --> 01:28:23,127
<i>- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.</i>

720
01:28:27,006 --> 01:28:28,716
That's no way to treat a friend.

721
01:31:27,311 --> 01:31:29,354
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

722
01:31:30,522 --> 01:31:33,483
Good evening, J.F.

723
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,495
<i>Tea?</i>

724
01:31:46,788 --> 01:31:48,624
<i>More tea?</i>

725
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:50,751
<i>Tea?</i>

726
01:32:00,302 --> 01:32:02,471
<i>More tea?</i>

727
01:32:04,431 --> 01:32:06,183
<i>Tea?</i>

728
01:32:07,768 --> 01:32:09,645
<i>More tea?</i>

729
01:32:11,271 --> 01:32:13,231
<i>More tea?</i>

730
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:27,496
<i>More tea?</i>

731
01:35:33,139 --> 01:35:36,893
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

732
01:35:38,436 --> 01:35:41,856
I thought you were supposed to be good.

733
01:35:43,149 --> 01:35:45,819
Aren't you the good man?

734
01:35:50,615 --> 01:35:54,285
Come on, Deckard.

735
01:35:55,495 --> 01:35:57,372
Show me...

736
01:35:58,206 --> 01:36:00,333
<i>...what you're made of.</i>

737
01:36:12,345 --> 01:36:14,222
Proud of yourself, little man?

738
01:36:22,105 --> 01:36:23,940
This is for Zhora.

739
01:36:25,525 --> 01:36:26,860
This is for Pris.

740
01:36:34,033 --> 01:36:35,535
Come on, Deckard.

741
01:36:36,077 --> 01:36:39,289
I'm right here, but you've
gotta shoot straight.

742
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:43,001
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough!

743
01:36:43,168 --> 01:36:44,252
Now it's my turn.

744
01:36:46,129 --> 01:36:49,841
I'm gonna give you a few
seconds before I come.

745
01:36:50,592 --> 01:36:51,843
One.

746
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:54,179
Two.

747
01:37:06,191 --> 01:37:08,067
Three.

748
01:37:08,234 --> 01:37:10,153
Four.

749
01:37:22,457 --> 01:37:24,125
Pris.

750
01:38:34,696 --> 01:38:39,075
I'm coming.

751
01:38:39,242 --> 01:38:41,035
Deckard!

752
01:38:43,454 --> 01:38:44,747
<i>Four, five</i>

753
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:51,170
<i>How to stay alive?</i>

754
01:39:14,068 --> 01:39:15,695
I can see you!

755
01:39:41,471 --> 01:39:43,806
Not yet!

756
01:39:43,973 --> 01:39:45,016
Not...

757
01:40:17,799 --> 01:40:19,550
Five.

758
01:40:22,804 --> 01:40:24,347
Five.

759
01:40:28,518 --> 01:40:29,727
Yes.

760
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:39,111
You better get it up.

761
01:40:39,737 --> 01:40:41,280
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

762
01:40:42,323 --> 01:40:44,575
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

763
01:40:44,742 --> 01:40:46,702
<i>And if you don't play...</i>

764
01:40:56,337 --> 01:40:58,548
<i>Six, seven</i>

765
01:40:58,714 --> 01:41:00,633
<i>Go to hell or go to heaven</i>

766
01:41:08,099 --> 01:41:09,809
Good, that's the spirit!

767
01:41:51,142 --> 01:41:53,311
That hurt.

768
01:41:56,605 --> 01:41:58,733
That was irrational of you.

769
01:42:00,693 --> 01:42:02,028
Not to mention...

770
01:42:02,653 --> 01:42:05,031
...unsportsmanlike.

771
01:42:08,909 --> 01:42:11,078
Where are you going?

772
01:45:15,554 --> 01:45:19,433
Quite an experience to
live in fear, isn't it?

773
01:45:21,143 --> 01:45:24,188
That's what it is to be a slave.

774
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,373
<i>I've...</i>

775
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:29,586
...seen things you people wouldn't believe.

776
01:46:31,171 --> 01:46:36,343
Attack ships on fire off
the shoulder of Orion.

777
01:46:38,262 --> 01:46:40,597
I watched C-beams...

778
01:46:40,806 --> 01:46:44,476
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

779
01:46:48,647 --> 01:46:50,691
All those...

780
01:46:50,858 --> 01:46:53,902
...moments will be lost...

781
01:46:54,069 --> 01:46:56,321
...in time...

782
01:46:57,865 --> 01:47:00,117
...like...

783
01:47:00,284 --> 01:47:02,035
...tears...

784
01:47:03,453 --> 01:47:05,706
...in rain.

785
01:47:09,293 --> 01:47:11,879
Time to die.

786
01:48:17,819 --> 01:48:20,739
You've done a man's job, sir.

787
01:48:26,411 --> 01:48:28,789
I guess you're through, huh?

788
01:48:30,832 --> 01:48:32,626
Finished.

789
01:48:54,648 --> 01:48:57,651
It's too bad she won't live.

790
01:48:58,652 --> 01:49:01,154
But then again, who does?

791
01:49:34,771 --> 01:49:36,648
Rachael?

792
01:49:44,364 --> 01:49:46,074
Rachael?

793
01:49:59,963 --> 01:50:01,548
Rachael?

794
01:51:08,281 --> 01:51:10,075
Do you love me?

795
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:12,952
I love you.

796
01:51:13,828 --> 01:51:15,705
Do you trust me?

797
01:51:16,915 --> 01:51:18,875
I trust you.

798
01:51:28,218 --> 01:51:29,969
Rachael?

799
01:52:09,551 --> 01:52:12,429
<i>It's too bad she won 't live.</i>

800
01:52:12,595 --> 01:52:15,223
<i>But then again, who does?</i>

801
01:57:31,455 --> 01:57:33,541

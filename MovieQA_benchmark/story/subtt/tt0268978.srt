1
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:32,270
Mathematicians
won the war.

2
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,040
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes-

3
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,509
and built the A-bomb.

4
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,946
Mathematicians...
like you.

5
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:46,782
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

6
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:49,049
In medicine or economics,

7
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:51,387
in technology or space,

8
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,289
battle lines are being drawn.

9
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:57,058
To triumph,
we need results-

10
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,964
publishable,
applicable results.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,335
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

12
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:06,704
The next Einstein?

13
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:08,709
Who among you will be
the vanguard...

14
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:12,569
of democracy, freedom,
and discovery?

15
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,215
Today, we bequeath
America's future...

16
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,879
into your able hands.

17
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:21,822
Welcome to Princeton,
gentlemen.

18
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,376
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:43,607
No, he has to have it
all for himself.

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,238
It's the first time
the Carnegie Prize...

21
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,307
has been split.
Hansen's all bent.

22
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:49,410
Rumor is he's got his sights
set on Wheeler Lab,

23
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,978
the new military
think tank at M.I.T.

24
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,751
They're only taking
one this year.

25
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:56,986
Hansen's used
to being picked first.

26
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,618
Oh, yeah,
he's wasted on math.

27
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:00,527
He should be running
for president.

28
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,507
There could be
a mathematical explanation...

29
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:14,170
for how bad your tie is.

30
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,477
Thank you.

31
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:24,147
Neilson,
symbol cryptography.

32
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:25,451
Neils here broke
a Jap code.

33
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,118
Helped rid the world
of fascism.

34
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,458
At least that's what he
tells the girls, eh, Neils?

35
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,396
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

36
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:34,524
- And you are?
- Am I late?

37
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,529
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Sol.

38
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,634
Oh, good.
Uh, hi.

39
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:41,500
- Sol. Richard Sol.
The burden of genius.

40
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:43,667
- There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.

41
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,370
Mr. Sol.
How are you, sir?

42
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:46,743
Ah, Bender.
Nice to see you.

43
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,272
Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
Ah, thank you.

44
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,784
I'll take another.

45
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:54,012
Excuse me?

46
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,487
A thousand pardons. I simply
assumed you were the waiter.

47
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:59,321
Play nice, Hansen. Nice is
not Hansen's strong suit.

48
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,225
Honest mistake.

49
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:03,786
Well, Martin Hansen.

50
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:07,766
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.

51
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:11,135
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

52
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:16,474
I've read your pre-prints-

53
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:18,235
both of them.

54
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,242
The one on Nazi ciphers,

55
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,080
and the other one
on nonlinear equations,

56
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:25,018
and I am
supremely confident...

57
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,486
that there is not
a single seminal...

58
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,250
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

59
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:34,127
Enjoy your punch.

60
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,201
Gentlemen, meet John Nash,

61
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:43,000
the mysterious
West Virginia genius.

62
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:46,701
The other winner of the
distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

63
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:47,606
Oh, okay.
Oh, yeah?

64
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:50,111
Of course.

65
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,838
Oh, Christ.

66
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:26,748
The prodigal
roommate arrives.

67
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,548
Roommate?

68
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,250
Oh, God, no.

69
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,415
Ugh.

70
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,025
Did you know that having
a hangover is-

71
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,551
is not having enough water
in your body...

72
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,621
to run your Krebs cycles?

73
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:43,634
Which is exactly
what happens to you...

74
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:45,260
when you're dying
of thirst.

75
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:48,306
So, dying
of thirst...

76
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:51,605
would probably feel...

77
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:54,271
pretty much like
the hangover...

78
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,610
that finally
bloody kills you.

79
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,449
John Nash?

80
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,418
Hello.

81
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,978
Charles Herman.

82
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,047
Pleased to meet you.

83
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,393
All right, well done.

84
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,437
Well, it's official.

85
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,604
I'm almost human again.

86
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,443
Officer, I saw
the driver who hit me.

87
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,210
His name was Johnny Walker.

88
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,384
Whew.

89
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:38,050
Well, I got in last night
in time for...

90
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,286
English department
cocktails.

91
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:41,953
Cock was mine,

92
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,055
the tail belonged to a
particularly lovely young thing...

93
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,726
with a passion for...

94
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:50,329
D.H. Lawrence. You're not
easily distracted, are you?

95
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,771
I'm here to work.
Hmmm, are you? Right.

96
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:55,106
I see.
Crikey!

97
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,785
Is my roommate a dick?

98
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:10,491
Hmm?

99
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,653
Listen.

100
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,060
If we can't break the ice,

101
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:17,399
how about we drown it?

102
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,140
So what's your story?

103
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:33,342
You the poor kid that never
got to go to Exeter or Andover?

104
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:35,949
Despite my privileged
upbringing,

105
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,419
I'm actually
quite well-balanced.

106
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:38,887
I have a chip
on both shoulders.

107
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,850
Maybe you're
just better...

108
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,862
with the old integers
than you are with people.

109
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,795
My first grade teacher,
she told me...

110
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,856
that I was born
with two helpings of brain,

111
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,561
but only half
a helping of heart.

112
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:54,469
Wow!
She sounds lovely!

113
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,064
The truth is that I-

114
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,542
I don't like people much.

115
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,738
And they don't
much like me.

116
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,042
But why,

117
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,810
with all your obvious
wit and charm?

118
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,377
Seriously, John.

119
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,488
Mathematics-

120
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:16,392
Mathematics is never going
to lead you to a higher truth.

121
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,430
And you know why?

122
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,930
'Cause it's boring.

123
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,591
It's really boring.

124
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,001
You know half these schoolboys
are already published?

125
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,607
I cannot waste time
with these classes...

126
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,405
and these books.

127
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,445
Memorizing the weaker
assumptions of lesser mortals!

128
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,750
I need to look through...

129
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,882
to the governing dynamics.

130
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,197
Find a truly original idea.

131
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,255
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

132
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,630
It's the only way
that I'll ever-

133
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,397
Matter.

134
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:59,900
Yes.

135
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,835
All right,
who's next?

136
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,641
No, I've played enough "Go"
for one day, thank you.

137
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,614
Come on.
I- I hate this game.

138
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,309
Cowards, all of you!

139
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,375
None of you rise
to meet my challenge?

140
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:12,010
Come on, Bender.
Whoever wins,

141
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,112
Sol does his laundry
all semester.

142
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,919
Does that seem unfair to
anyone else? Not at all.

143
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,358
- Look at him.
- Nash!

144
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,057
Taking a reverse
constitutional?

145
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:24,964
I'm hoping to extract
an algorithm...

146
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:26,969
to define
their movement.

147
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,473
Oh.
Psycho.

148
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,377
Hey, Nash, I thought
you dropped out.

149
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:37,072
You ever going
to go to class or-

150
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:39,479
Classes will
dull your mind.

151
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:43,007
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

152
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,021
Oh, oh, I didn't
know that.

153
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,182
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

154
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,850
Which is another way
of saying...

155
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,917
he doesn't have
the nerve to compete.

156
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,195
You scared?

157
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:55,698
Terrified.

158
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,165
Mortified.
Petrified.

159
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:58,895
Stupefied... by you.

160
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,531
No starch.

161
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,597
Pressed and folded.

162
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,512
Let me ask
you something, John.

163
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,411
Be my guest, Martin.

164
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,245
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed...

165
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,376
Allen's proof
of Peyrot's Conjecture.

166
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:16,512
Adequate work...

167
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:18,283
without innovation.

168
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,119
Oh. I'm flattered.
You flattered?

169
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,352
Flattered.

170
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,587
And I've got
two weapons briefs...

171
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,063
under security review
by the D.O.D.

172
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:28,327
Derivative drivel.

173
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,200
But Nash achievements:

174
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,567
zero.

175
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:35,472
I'm a patient man, Martin. Is
there an actual question coming?

176
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,978
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

177
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:42,037
Huh?

178
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,550
How will it feel when
I'm chosen for Wheeler...

179
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:47,781
and you're not?

180
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,490
What if you lose?

181
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,396
Ah, there it is.

182
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:04,671
You should not have won.

183
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,172
Hmmm.

184
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,835
I had the first move,
my-my play was perfect.

185
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,400
The hubris
of the defeated.

186
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:12,708
The game is flawed.

187
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:21,722
Gentlemen,
the great John Nash.

188
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:31,389
You've been in here
for two days.

189
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,299
You know Hansen's
just published another paper?

190
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,567
I can't even find a topic
for my doctorate.

191
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,768
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

192
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,676
This is a group
playing touch football.

193
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:52,119
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

194
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,749
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.

195
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,959
John, you watched
a mugging.

196
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,464
That's weird.

197
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:05,229
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

198
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

199
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:12,406
See, if I could derive
an equilibrium...

200
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:15,036
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,

201
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:17,478
where nobody loses,

202
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:19,539
can you imagine the effect
that would have...

203
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:23,553
on conflict scenarios, and arms
negotiations... When did you last eat?

204
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,090
When did you last eat?
... currency exchange?

205
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,921
You know, food.

206
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,990
You have no respect for
cognitive reverie, you know that?

207
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:35,090
Yes. But pizza-

208
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:39,096
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

209
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:42,265
And of course beer.

210
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,340
I have respect for beer.

211
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:54,175
I have respect for beer!

212
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,960
Good evening, Neils.
Hey, Nash.

213
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,965
Who's winning? You or you?

214
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,729
Evening, Nash.
Hey, guys.

215
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,702
Hey, Nash.

216
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,501
He's looking
at you for sure.

217
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,871
Hey, Nash.

218
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:21,539
Neils is trying
to get your attention.

219
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:23,947
You’re joking.
Oh, no.

220
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:31,683
Go with God.
Come back a man.

221
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,824
Fortune favors the brave.
Bombs away.

222
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:41,933
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

223
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,971
dramatically improve
with each attempt.

224
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,640
This is going
to be classic.

225
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:28,249
Maybe you want
to buy me a drink.

226
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,458
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say...

227
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,256
in order for you
to have intercourse with me,

228
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,998
but could we assume
that I said all that?

229
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,966
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

230
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:45,936
So, could we just
go straight to the sex?

231
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,937
Oh, that was sweet.

232
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,969
Have a nice night,
asshole!

233
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,206
Ladies, wait!

234
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:58,044
I-

235
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,278
I especially liked
the bit about fluid exchange.

236
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,482
It was really charming.

237
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,291
Walk with me, John.

238
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:11,593
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

239
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:15,600
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

240
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:18,159
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

241
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:20,297
Wheeler, sir. That
would be my first choice.

242
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,830
And actually, I don't really
have a second choice, sir.

243
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:25,071
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

244
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,110
They've written papers.
They've published.

245
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:29,976
I'm still searching, sir,
for my-

246
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:31,780
Your original idea, I know.
Governing dynamics, sir.

247
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,514
It's very clever, John,
but I'm afraid...

248
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,954
it's just not nearly
good enough.

249
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,927
May I?
Thank you.

250
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,695
I've been working
on manifold embedding.

251
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,862
My bargaining stratagems are
starting to show some promise.

252
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:50,565
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

253
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,698
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein-

254
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:54,732
I've repeatedly asked
you for that. Now, John.

255
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,301
I'd be able to show him my revisions on his
- John? John.

256
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,940
Do you see what they're
doing in there?

257
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:03,678
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

258
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:07,613
Congratulations,
Professor Max.

259
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,090
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

260
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:12,561
It's the pens.

261
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:14,892
Reserved for a member
of the department...

262
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:16,864
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime.

263
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,598
Now, what do you see, John?

264
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:22,402
Recognition.

265
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:25,236
Well done, Professor.
Well done.

266
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,743
Well, try seeing
accomplishment.

267
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,608
Is there a difference?

268
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,977
John,

269
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:34,313
you haven't focused.

270
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,478
I'm sorry,
but up to this point,

271
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:40,250
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

272
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,288
Good day.

273
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,667
And my compliments
to you, sir.

274
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:59,801
Thank you so much.

275
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:18,430
I can't see it.

276
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:28,406
- Aah!
- Jesus Christ, John.

277
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,875
I can't fail.

278
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:33,845
This is all I am.
Come on, let's go out.

279
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,905
I got to get something done. John!

280
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:38,815
- I can't keep staring into space.
- John, enough!

281
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:41,410
Got to face the wall, follow
their rules, read their books,

282
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:42,978
You want to do
some damage? Fine-

283
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,149
But don't mess around.
do their classes.

284
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:47,319
Come on!
Go on, bust your head!

285
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,056
Kill yourself.

286
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,496
Don't do it.
Don't mess around.

287
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,329
Bust your head!
Go on,

288
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,335
bust that worthless head
wide open.

289
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:57,496
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?!

290
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,536
It's not my problem.

291
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:06,841
And it's not your problem.

292
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:12,185
It's their problem.

293
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:15,348
Your answer isn't
face the wall.

294
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,756
It's out there...

295
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:19,453
where you've been working.

296
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:43,175
That was heavy.

297
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,920
That Isaac Newton fellow
was right.

298
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:50,790
He was onto something.
Clever boy.

299
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:56,121
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

300
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,566
Oh, God.

301
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:03,238
Incoming, gentlemen.
Ay-yi-yi.

302
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:08,944
Deep breaths.

303
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,772
Nash, you might
want to stop...

304
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,081
shuffling your papers
for five seconds.

305
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,381
I will not buy
you gentlemen beer.

306
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,018
Oh, we're not here
for beer, my friend.

307
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:25,995
Oh.

308
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,861
Does anyone else feel she
should be moving in slow motion?

309
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,564
Will she want
a large wedding, ya think?

310
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,106
Shall we say swords,
gentlemen?

311
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,143
Pistols at dawn?
Have you remembered nothing?

312
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,542
Recall the lessons
of Adam Smith,

313
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,547
the father
of modern economics.

314
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,446
"In competition...

315
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,213
individual ambition
serves the common good. "

316
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,585
- Exactly.
- Every man for himself, gentlemen.

317
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,648
And those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

318
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,591
I'm not gonna strike out.

319
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,129
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

320
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,222
- I don't think he said that.
- Nobody move-

321
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,324
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

322
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,097
Oh, God. He may have
the upper hand now,

323
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,332
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

324
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,534
Remember the last time?

325
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,839
Oh, yes, that was one
for the history books.

326
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:20,684
- Adam Smith needs revision.
- What are you talking about?

327
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:23,417
If we all go for the blonde,

328
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:29,490
we block each other.

329
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:33,865
Not a single one of us
is gonna get her.

330
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:36,598
So then we go
for her friends,

331
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:39,438
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder...

332
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:42,068
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

333
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:45,079
Well, what if no one goes
for the blonde?

334
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,913
We don't get
in each other's way,

335
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:51,920
and we don't insult
the other girls.

336
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,286
That's the only way we win.

337
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,858
That's the only
way we all get laid.

338
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,699
Adam Smith said...

339
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,135
the best result comes...

340
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:10,470
from everyone
in the group doing...

341
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:12,032
what's best
for himself, right?

342
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:13,098
That's what he
said, right?

343
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:14,008
Right.
Incomplete.

344
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:16,137
Incomplete, okay?

345
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:18,773
Because the best result
will come...

346
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:21,545
from everyone
in the group...

347
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,281
doing what's best
for himself...

348
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:26,152
and the group.

349
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:28,418
Nash, if this is some way for
you to get the blonde on your own,

350
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:31,224
you can go to hell.
Governing dynamics.

351
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:34,288
Governing dynamics.
Adam Smith...

352
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:36,061
was wrong.

353
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:38,898
Oh, here we go.
Careful, careful.

354
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,198
Thank you.

355
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:57,822
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

356
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:02,182
You do realize this
flies in the face...

357
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:05,022
of a 150 years of economic
theory? Yes, I do, sir.

358
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:06,994
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

359
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:08,893
It is, sir.

360
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:17,705
Well, Mr. Nash,

361
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:20,709
with a breakthrough
of this magnitude,

362
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:24,838
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

363
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:32,918
Wheeler Labs,

364
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,619
they'll ask you to recommend
two team members.

365
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,252
Yes!

366
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:42,389
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

367
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:44,366
Sol and Bender, sir.

368
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:48,098
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

369
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:50,198
Has it occurred to you
that Sol and Bender...

370
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,833
might have plans
of their own?

371
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,371
We made it!

372
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:59,383
Wheeler, we made it!

373
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:05,117
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
To- Oh! Oh!

374
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,750
Okay, awkward moment,
gentlemen.

375
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,871
Umm...

376
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,817
Hmm.

377
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:34,449
Governing dynamics.

378
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,619
Congratulations, John.
Thanks.

379
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,627
Toast!
To Wheeler Labs!

380
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:42,754
To Wheeler!

381
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,280
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

382
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:11,121
Dr. Nash, your coat?

383
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,219
Thank you, sir.

384
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:17,231
Doctor. General, this is Wheeler
team leader Dr. John Nash.

385
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,096
Glad you could
come, Doctor.

386
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,602
Hello.

387
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,535
Right this way.

388
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:26,405
We've been intercepting radio
transmissions from Moscow.

389
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:28,909
The computer can't
detect a pattern,

390
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:30,708
but I'm sure
it's code.

391
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,113
Why is that, General?

392
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:35,674
Ever just know
something, Dr. Nash?

393
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,880
Constantly.

394
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,320
We've developed several ciphers.

395
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:48,395
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data...

396
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:53,560
Doctor?
6-7-3-7,

397
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:55,572
0-3-6...

398
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:11,179
8-4-9-4.

399
00:26:40,787 --> 00:26:42,778
9-1-4-0-3-4.

400
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:02,266
I need a map.

401
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,535
46-13-08,

402
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:09,208
67-46-90.

403
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,380
Starkey Corners, Maine.

404
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:16,283
48-03-01,

405
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:19,759
91-26-35.

406
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:21,659
Prairie Portage,
Minnesota.

407
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,722
These are latitudes
and longitudes.

408
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,495
There are a least 10 others.

409
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:29,036
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

410
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:33,539
Extraordinary.

411
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:38,046
Gentlemen, we need
to move on this.

412
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:43,074
Who's Big Brother? You've done
your country a great service, son.

413
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:46,417
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

414
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:48,855
Accompany Dr. Nash.

415
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,861
What are the Russians
moving, General?

416
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,521
Captain Rogers
will escort you...

417
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:55,428
to the unrestricted
area, Doctor.

418
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,126
Thank you.

419
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,567
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

420
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,105
None of those who have
said they don't like the method...

421
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,140
have told us any other method they
could use that would be effective.

422
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,312
And when you hear...
It's Dr. Nash.

423
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,355
All right.

424
00:28:31,402 --> 00:28:33,667
Thank you, sir.
Home run at the Pentagon?

425
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:35,333
Have they actually
taken the word "classified"

426
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:36,671
out of the dictionary?

427
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,344
Oh, hi. The air
conditioning broke again.

428
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:42,471
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world...

429
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:45,381
if I'm melting? Our
hearts go out to you.

430
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:48,477
You know, two trips
to the Pentagon in four years.

431
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:49,748
That's two more
than we've had.

432
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:51,551
It gets better,
John.

433
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:54,185
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

434
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:56,195
You know, the Russians
have the H-bomb,

435
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:58,356
the Nazis are repatriating
South America,

436
00:28:58,431 --> 00:29:01,730
the Chinese have
a standing army of 2.8 million,

437
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:05,328
and I am doing
stress tests on a dam.

438
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,169
You made the cover
of Fortune... again.

439
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:10,835
Please note the use
of the word "you," not "we. "

440
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:13,380
That was supposed
to be just me.

441
00:29:13,414 --> 00:29:15,848
Oh.

442
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:19,109
So not only do they rob me
of the Fields Medal,

443
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:21,178
now they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine...

444
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:23,713
with these hacks,
these scholars of trivia.

445
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:25,385
John, exactly what's
the difference...

446
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:28,224
between genius
and most genius?

447
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:30,059
Quite a lot.

448
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:31,928
He's your son.

449
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,867
Anyway, you've got
10 minutes.

450
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:35,631
I've always got 10 minutes.

451
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,969
Before your new class?

452
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:45,539
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

453
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:49,141
You are a doctor, John,
and no.

454
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,552
Now, come on, you know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities,

455
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:54,715
M.I.T. gets America's
great minds of today...

456
00:29:54,757 --> 00:29:56,816
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

457
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:58,417
Poor bastards.

458
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:00,553
Now, have a nice
day at school.

459
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,063
The bell's ringing.

460
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,314
The eager young minds
of tomorrow.

461
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,527
Can we leave one open,
Professor?

462
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,035
It's really hot, sir.

463
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,773
Your comfort comes second...

464
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,934
to my ability
to hear my own voice.

465
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,714
Personally,

466
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:56,812
I think this class will be
a waste... of your-

467
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,754
and what is
infinitely worse-

468
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,257
my time.

469
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,196
However, here we are.

470
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:10,065
So you may attend or not.

471
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:12,331
You may complete your
assignments at your whim.

472
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:14,636
We have begun.

473
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,776
Miss.

474
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:23,507
Excuse me!

475
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,051
Excuse me!
Hey, hey!

476
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,882
Hi!

477
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,889
Um, we have
a little problem.

478
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:34,052
It’s extremely hot in here
with the windows closed...

479
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:36,722
and extremely noisy
with them open.

480
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:39,164
So, I was wondering
if there was any way you could,

481
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,030
I don't know,
maybe work someplace else...

482
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:42,831
for about 45 minutes?

483
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:45,737
- Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

484
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:47,741
At a break!
Got it!

485
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:51,575
Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

486
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:54,673
As you will find
in multivariable calculus,

487
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,513
there is often...

488
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:59,315
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

489
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:05,321
As I was saying,
this problem here...

490
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:09,160
will take some of you
many months to solve.

491
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:10,994
For others among you,

492
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,466
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

493
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:31,083
Professor Nash.

494
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:46,366
William Parcher.

495
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:52,034
Big Brother...
at your service.

496
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,704
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?

497
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,510
- Are you here to give me a raise?
- Let's take a walk.

498
00:32:59,885 --> 00:33:02,752
Impressive work at the
Pentagon. Yes, it was.

499
00:33:02,821 --> 00:33:04,186
Oppenheimer used to say,

500
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,781
"Genius sees the answer
before the question. "

501
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:08,792
You knew Oppenheimer?

502
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,522
His project was
under my supervision.

503
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:13,564
Which project?

504
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,294
That project.

505
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,031
It's not that simple,
you know?

506
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:20,766
Well, you ended
the war.

507
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,435
We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.

508
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,377
Great deeds come
at great cost, Mr. Parcher.

509
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:31,110
Well, conviction,
it turns out,

510
00:33:31,184 --> 00:33:34,450
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

511
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,249
I'll try
and keep that in mind.

512
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:44,291
So, John, no family,

513
00:33:44,364 --> 00:33:46,195
no close friends-

514
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,790
Why is that?

515
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:49,836
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

516
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:54,136
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

517
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:57,067
Well, there are
certain endeavors...

518
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:58,976
where your lack
of personal connection...

519
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:01,106
would be considered
an advantage.

520
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:06,318
This is a secure area.
They know me.

521
00:34:09,057 --> 00:34:10,581
Have you ever
been here?

522
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:12,489
We were told during
our initial briefing...

523
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,529
that these warehouses
were abandoned.

524
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:16,758
That's not
precisely accurate.

525
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,696
By telling you
what I'm about to tell you,

526
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,468
I am increasing
your security clearance...

527
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,202
to top secret.

528
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:02,906
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

529
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,311
Get it?

530
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:06,373
What operation?

531
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:14,015
Those are a good idea.

532
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:21,493
This factory is in Berlin. We
seized it at the end of the war.

533
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,295
Nazi engineers
were attempting...

534
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:25,962
to build a portable
atomic bomb.

535
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:28,666
The Soviets reached
this facility before we did,

536
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,401
and we lost the damn thing.

537
00:35:32,711 --> 00:35:34,839
The routing orders
at the Pentagon,

538
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:37,109
they were about this,
weren't they?

539
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:40,983
The Soviets aren't
as unified as people believe.

540
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:44,649
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svoboda,

541
00:35:44,724 --> 00:35:47,090
"the New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb...

542
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,754
and intends to detonate it
on U.S. soil.

543
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:54,730
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

544
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:02,608
Man is capable of as much atrocity
as he has imagination.

545
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:07,511
New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.

546
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,516
McCarthy is an idiot,

547
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:12,643
but unfortunately
that doesn't make him wrong.

548
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,623
New Freedom communicates
to its agents...

549
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,524
through codes imbedded
in newspapers and magazines,

550
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,186
and that's
where you come in.

551
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:25,528
You see, John,
what distinguishes you...

552
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,363
is that you are,

553
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,027
quite simply,

554
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,870
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

555
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:41,439
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

556
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:49,481
Commit this list
of periodicals to memory.

557
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:54,654
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

558
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,392
decipher them.

559
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:00,595
Place your chin
on the chin rest.

560
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,470
Stare into the light.
Pulse 88, regular.

561
00:37:06,943 --> 00:37:09,434
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

562
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:14,183
That's got a little
zap to it, doesn't it?

563
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:17,449
He just implanted
a radium diode.

564
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:19,581
Don't worry, it's safe.

565
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,453
The isotope decays
predictably.

566
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:25,724
As a result,
these numbers change over time.

567
00:37:25,797 --> 00:37:29,164
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

568
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:34,101
So what am I now,
a spy?

569
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:48,344
Come.

570
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:54,853
Boy, you must be
really important.

571
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:05,003
It's all right, Mike.

572
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:15,680
What are you
working on?

573
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:19,679
Classified.

574
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:23,352
Everyone waited half an hour.

575
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:26,518
For?
Class.

576
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:28,721
You missed class today.

577
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:32,528
Oh. I suspect that...

578
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,864
nobody missed me.

579
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:39,129
The problem that you left
on the board-

580
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:41,301
I solved it.

581
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:45,676
Oh, no you didn't.
You didn't even look.

582
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:49,774
I never said that the vector
fields were rational functions.

583
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:56,186
Your solution is elegant.

584
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,027
Though on this
particular occasion,

585
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:04,089
ultimately incorrect.

586
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:29,117
- You're still here.
- I'm still here.

587
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:31,660
Why?

588
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:35,220
I'm wondering,
Professor Nash,

589
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:38,768
if I can ask you to dinner.

590
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,975
You do eat, don't you?

591
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:47,477
Oh, on occasion, yeah.

592
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:50,207
Table for one. Prometheus
alone chained to the rock...

593
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:52,579
with the bird circling
overhead, you know how it is.

594
00:39:55,753 --> 00:39:57,847
No, I expect
that you wouldn't-

595
00:39:57,923 --> 00:39:59,618
you wouldn't know, uh-

596
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:04,657
If you leave your address
with my office,

597
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,824
I'll pick you up
Friday at 8:00...

598
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,425
and we'll eat.

599
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:20,111
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

600
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,671
or should I just
keep calling you "Miss"?

601
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:25,845
Governor,

602
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:28,410
may I present-
Miss Alicia Larde.

603
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,319
Miss Alicia Larde.
How do you do?

604
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,381
Professor, please.
You and the governor.

605
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:37,220
Wait, one second.
I'm sorry.

606
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,300
I want a copy of this.

607
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:42,598
First big date and all,
you know.

608
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,730
So, you boys need
to look good.

609
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,005
Which is not a state
you find yourselves in...

610
00:40:49,076 --> 00:40:52,239
altogether naturally.

611
00:40:54,782 --> 00:40:57,843
There. Better.

612
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,990
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

613
00:41:02,057 --> 00:41:03,888
Professor.

614
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,637
God must be a painter.

615
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:26,078
Why else would we
have so many colors?

616
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:31,216
So you're a painter?

617
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:34,017
That's not actually
what I said,

618
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,854
but, yes-

619
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:39,054
I am.

620
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:49,699
Here.

621
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,673
Me.

622
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,266
Your date?

623
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:58,005
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

624
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,176
That's a plan.

625
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,416
Champagne would be lovely.

626
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,760
I'll be outside.

627
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,921
I will get the champagne.

628
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,200
Oh, thank you.

629
00:42:23,476 --> 00:42:24,943
Thank you for that.

630
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,376
No, keep it.

631
00:42:27,446 --> 00:42:30,677
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

632
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,581
Do you?

633
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,585
No.

634
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,621
I don't believe in luck.

635
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:43,554
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

636
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,395
Oh.

637
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,331
I once tried
to count them all.

638
00:42:57,477 --> 00:43:02,142
I actually made it
to 4,348.

639
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:06,612
You are exceptionally odd.

640
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:09,554
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

641
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:17,330
A pair of odd ducks, then.

642
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,993
Mmm.

643
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:24,600
Pick a shape.

644
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:27,636
What?

645
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,941
Pick a shape. An animal
- anything.

646
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:35,978
Okay.

647
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:38,577
An umbrella.

648
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:18,492
Do it again.

649
00:44:18,562 --> 00:44:20,155
Do it again.
All right.

650
00:44:20,232 --> 00:44:21,893
What would you like?
Do, uh...

651
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:24,492
an octopus.

652
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,580
You don't talk much, do you?

653
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:19,413
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

654
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:21,317
I don't mean work.

655
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,894
I find that polishing
my interactions...

656
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:31,954
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

657
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:36,194
I have a tendency to
expedite information flow...

658
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:40,872
by being direct.

659
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,371
I often don't get
a pleasant result.

660
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:45,708
Try me.

661
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:49,444
All right.

662
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:55,086
I find you attractive.

663
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:58,292
Your aggressive
moves towards me...

664
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:00,156
indicate that you
feel the same way.

665
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:03,027
But still,
ritual requires that we...

666
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:05,829
continue with a number
of platonic activities...

667
00:48:05,901 --> 00:48:08,165
before we have sex.

668
00:48:08,237 --> 00:48:11,468
I am proceeding
with those activities,

669
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,531
but in point
of actual fact,

670
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:17,705
all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

671
00:48:19,882 --> 00:48:22,010
Are you gonna
slap me now?

672
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:48,704
How was that result?

673
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:07,655
What are you doing?

674
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,762
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences...

675
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,502
within periodicals
over time. And you?

676
00:49:17,576 --> 00:49:19,771
You talk funny,
Mr. Nash.

677
00:49:24,017 --> 00:49:25,951
Do I know you?

678
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:28,351
My uncle says
you're very smart...

679
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:30,116
but not very nice,

680
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,283
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

681
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:34,383
And who might
your uncle be?

682
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,894
The prodigal roommate...

683
00:49:36,963 --> 00:49:38,863
returns.

684
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:45,033
Come here.
Charles, Charles, Charles.

685
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:52,404
My sister...

686
00:49:52,479 --> 00:49:54,811
got herself killed
in a car crash.

687
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:57,476
Not too far now,
Marcee!

688
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:00,615
Her cowboy husband
was too drunk...

689
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:03,146
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

690
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:05,659
So, I took her in.

691
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:10,327
She's so small. She's young,
John. That's how they come.

692
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,491
I'm at Harvard...

693
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:17,265
doing the great
author's workshop.

694
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,398
D.H. bloody Lawrence.

695
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,602
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

696
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,873
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

697
00:50:27,883 --> 00:50:30,113
How are you, John?

698
00:50:30,186 --> 00:50:33,246
At first all my work
here was trivial,

699
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,984
but a new assignment
came up and-

700
00:50:36,058 --> 00:50:39,084
I can't really tell you
any details.

701
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,460
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

702
00:50:41,531 --> 00:50:43,692
Something like that.

703
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:47,464
And, uh...
Yes?

704
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:49,471
Well, I- I met a girl.

705
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:52,474
No! A human girl?
Homo sapien.

706
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:54,703
A biped? Yup. And contrary
to all probabilities,

707
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:56,746
she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

708
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,145
Really?

709
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:01,446
God, that's wonderful.

710
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,352
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

711
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:08,484
Should I marry her?

712
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,527
Oh, God. Right.

713
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:12,859
I mean, everything's
going well.

714
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,524
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

715
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,295
It all seems to add up.

716
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:20,269
But how do you know
for sure?

717
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,643
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

718
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:27,770
That's the only
sure thing I do know.

719
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:36,778
Good evening.

720
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:45,531
Alicia, please don't
be angry.

721
00:51:45,598 --> 00:51:47,122
I just lost track
of time at work...

722
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:50,327
again.
Mm-hmm.

723
00:51:50,403 --> 00:51:52,837
I'm sorry.

724
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:55,872
I didn't have time
to wrap it.

725
00:51:55,942 --> 00:51:58,433
Happy birthday.

726
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,775
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

727
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:06,683
they create
a full wavelength dispersal,

728
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:08,745
so if you look inside it,
you can see-

729
00:52:08,823 --> 00:52:11,451
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

730
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:12,958
Yeah.

731
00:52:13,027 --> 00:52:15,393
Remember you said that time
God must be a painter,

732
00:52:15,463 --> 00:52:18,261
because of all the colors,
at the governor's house?

733
00:52:18,332 --> 00:52:20,129
you said that.

734
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:22,363
I didn't think
you were listening.

735
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,933
I'm always listening.

736
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,877
It's beautiful.

737
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,830
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

738
00:52:54,904 --> 00:52:56,667
'Cause I need
some kind of proof,

739
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:58,969
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

740
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,741
I'm sorry,
just give me a moment...

741
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:12,245
to redefine my girlish
notions of romance.

742
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,754
A proof?

743
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,420
Verifiable data.

744
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:22,158
Um... okay.

745
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:27,833
Well, how big
is the universe?

746
00:53:27,906 --> 00:53:29,498
Infinite.

747
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,802
How do you know?

748
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,638
I know because
all the data indicate it.

749
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,439
But it hasn't been proven yet? No.

750
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,343
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

751
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:39,349
I don't, I just believe it.

752
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,009
Mmm.

753
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,852
It's the same
with love, I guess.

754
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:54,058
Now,

755
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:56,260
the part that
you don't know...

756
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:01,270
is if I want
to marry you.

757
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:24,427
Smile for the camera!

758
00:54:27,602 --> 00:54:29,092
Well done!

759
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,104
Oh, sweet pea.

760
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:32,867
I love you.
Congratulations.

761
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,703
Hey, Sol.

762
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:37,005
You look beautiful.

763
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,307
Hi, how are you?

764
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:46,249
Hey, Sol.

765
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:48,289
Bye bye.
Bye, now.

766
00:54:48,357 --> 00:54:50,382
- Bye!
- Bye!

767
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:52,086
Be safe!

768
00:55:21,224 --> 00:55:23,055
Get in.
Hurry.

769
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:29,398
They're following us.

770
00:55:33,003 --> 00:55:34,561
Who's-
Who's following us?

771
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:36,265
The drop's been
compromised.

772
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,240
Get down!

773
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,378
Stay down.

774
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:11,339
- Here, take this.
- I ain't shooting anybody.

775
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,106
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

776
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,772
Son of a-

777
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:34,526
You stay back.
Don't move.

778
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,750
John?

779
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,416
Hi.

780
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,525
Where were you?

781
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:41,466
S- Sol-
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

782
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:44,166
He said you left
the office hours ago.

783
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,207
Why didn't you
call me?

784
00:57:53,617 --> 00:57:55,278
Are you all right?

785
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:06,255
Honey?

786
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,428
John...

787
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:12,561
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

788
00:58:13,672 --> 00:58:15,970
John,
open the door.

789
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:20,611
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

790
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,647
Talk to me!

791
00:58:23,682 --> 00:58:25,241
John!

792
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:28,378
Open the door!

793
00:58:45,038 --> 00:58:46,767
Watch for cars, kids.

794
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:31,311
John.

795
00:59:31,387 --> 00:59:33,821
William.

796
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:36,187
This is not what
I signed on for.

797
00:59:36,258 --> 00:59:38,249
Every time a car
backfires or a door slams-

798
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:42,127
I understand
- better than you could possibly imagine.

799
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:54,367
You need
to calm down, John.

800
00:59:54,444 --> 00:59:57,072
Now listen to me. We're
closing in on the bomb,

801
00:59:57,147 --> 00:59:59,513
in large part
due to your work.

802
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:02,211
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

803
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:05,118
William, my circumstance
has changed.

804
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:07,521
Alicia's pregnant.

805
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,894
I told you attachments
were dangerous.

806
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,962
You chose to marry
the girl.

807
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,599
I did nothing
to prevent it.

808
01:00:27,312 --> 01:00:29,803
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

809
01:00:29,882 --> 01:00:32,043
is for you to continue
your work.

810
01:00:33,118 --> 01:00:34,710
Well, I'll just quit.

811
01:00:34,786 --> 01:00:36,583
You won't.

812
01:00:36,655 --> 01:00:38,247
Why would I not?

813
01:00:38,323 --> 01:00:41,451
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

814
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:44,257
You quit
working for me,

815
01:00:44,329 --> 01:00:47,026
I quit working for you.

816
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,837
Parcher!

817
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:09,414
John, you all right?

818
01:01:30,178 --> 01:01:31,611
John?

819
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,272
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

820
01:01:37,052 --> 01:01:38,713
Why would you
do that?

821
01:01:38,787 --> 01:01:40,448
Why would you
turn the light on?

822
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:41,989
What is wrong
with you?

823
01:01:42,057 --> 01:01:43,957
You have to go
to your sister's.

824
01:01:45,593 --> 01:01:47,721
I left the car out the back.
You take Commonwealth.

825
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:50,857
No side streets, you stay where it's
crowded. John, I'm not going anywhere!

826
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:53,333
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

827
01:01:53,402 --> 01:01:55,495
No, I'm not going.
Just get your things.

828
01:01:55,571 --> 01:01:58,131
I'm not leaving-
Stop! Stop it!

829
01:01:58,207 --> 01:02:00,801
Please, Alicia.

830
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:04,141
I'll explain
when I can.

831
01:02:50,596 --> 01:02:54,691
Uncle John!

832
01:02:56,935 --> 01:03:00,393
Hey, baby girl!

833
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:03,236
Wow, someone
needed a hug!

834
01:03:03,308 --> 01:03:05,902
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

835
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:08,209
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture...

836
01:03:08,281 --> 01:03:10,442
by the inimitable
John Nash?"

837
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,417
What's wrong?

838
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:20,585
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

839
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,491
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

840
01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:24,757
Professor Nash!

841
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:27,062
Welcome!

842
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:30,565
After?

843
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:40,340
So, we see that
the- the zeroes,

844
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:43,008
of the Reimann
Zeta function,

845
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:45,814
correspond
to singularities...

846
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:49,118
in space-time,

847
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:52,092
singularities
in space-time-

848
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:57,863
and conventional
number theory...

849
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:04,329
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

850
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,781
Sometimes
our expectations...

851
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,292
are betrayed
by the numbers.

852
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,386
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

853
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:30,024
rational value.

854
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:51,980
Professor Nash!

855
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:04,394
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

856
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:08,602
Professor Nash,

857
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:12,110
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

858
01:05:12,178 --> 01:05:14,203
What do you want?

859
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,874
My name is Rosen,

860
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:18,940
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

861
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:22,112
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

862
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:24,850
I'd like you
to come with me, John.

863
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:27,792
Just for a chat.

864
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,863
It appears I have
no choice.

865
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:35,501
Oh-hh!

866
01:05:42,475 --> 01:05:44,170
Help me!
Somebody!

867
01:05:48,182 --> 01:05:49,740
Somebody!

868
01:05:49,817 --> 01:05:53,253
Help me!
Get off me!

869
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:55,653
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

870
01:05:55,723 --> 01:05:57,384
No, no, no,
no, don't.

871
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,323
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

872
01:05:59,393 --> 01:06:01,224
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

873
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:02,762
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

874
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,593
Get away from me.

875
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:06,895
Stay away from me!

876
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,331
There, now.

877
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:16,240
All better.

878
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:22,146
Everything's
all right here.

879
01:06:23,986 --> 01:06:26,045
Watch your head.

880
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,452
John?

881
01:06:59,523 --> 01:07:01,548
Can you hear me?

882
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,340
Go easy now.

883
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:20,310
Thorazine takes a
little while to wear off.

884
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:25,679
Sorry about
the restraints.

885
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,310
You've got one hell
of a right hook.

886
01:07:28,386 --> 01:07:31,515
Where am I?

887
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,251
Ahem.

888
01:07:33,326 --> 01:07:35,658
MacArthur
Psychiatric Hospital.

889
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:41,498
I find that
highly unlikely.

890
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:43,057
You made
a mistake.

891
01:07:43,135 --> 01:07:47,037
My work is non-military
in application.

892
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:49,598
Which work
is that, John?

893
01:07:51,745 --> 01:07:53,542
I don't know
anything.

894
01:07:53,613 --> 01:07:56,173
There's no good
in keeping secrets, you know.

895
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:14,663
Charles?

896
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:17,628
Charles?

897
01:08:19,374 --> 01:08:21,308
I didn't mean to get you
involved in this.

898
01:08:23,644 --> 01:08:25,509
I'm- I'm sorry.

899
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:32,218
Charles?

900
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:40,828
The prodigal roommate
revealed.

901
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:46,895
"Saw my name
on the lecture slate. "

902
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:49,096
You lying son
of a bitch!

903
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:51,902
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

904
01:08:51,975 --> 01:08:54,569
How do you say,
"Charles Herman" in Russian?

905
01:08:54,644 --> 01:08:57,135
How do you say it
in Russian?

906
01:08:57,213 --> 01:09:00,512
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

907
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:03,143
He's right there.
He's right there.

908
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:06,313
Stop!
I don't know anything!

909
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:09,051
Stop!
I- I don't know anything!

910
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:13,292
My name is John Nash.

911
01:09:13,364 --> 01:09:14,991
I'm being held
against my will.

912
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:17,625
Somebody call
the Department of Defense.

913
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:19,464
My name is John Nash.

914
01:09:19,537 --> 01:09:22,028
I'm being held
against my will!

915
01:09:27,077 --> 01:09:29,568
What's wrong with him?

916
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,514
John has
schizophrenia.

917
01:09:34,586 --> 01:09:38,352
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

918
01:09:40,258 --> 01:09:43,819
But-
But his work.

919
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:46,125
He deals
with conspiracies...

920
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:49,396
Yes, yes, I know.

921
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:53,633
In John's world, these
behaviors are... accepted,

922
01:09:53,706 --> 01:09:55,333
encouraged.

923
01:09:55,408 --> 01:09:58,844
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated...

924
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,708
far longer
than is typical.

925
01:10:01,814 --> 01:10:03,338
What do you mean?
How long?

926
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:05,509
Possibly since
graduate school?

927
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:08,850
At least that's when his
hallucinations seem to have begun.

928
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:11,254
What are you talking
about? What hallucinations?

929
01:10:11,325 --> 01:10:13,555
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

930
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:17,028
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

931
01:10:18,599 --> 01:10:20,533
Charles
isn't imaginary.

932
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:23,195
He and John have been best
friends since Princeton.

933
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:26,239
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

934
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:29,207
He's always in town for
so little time, lecturing.

935
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:32,075
Was he at your wedding?
He had to teach.

936
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:33,773
Have you ever
seen a picture of him,

937
01:10:33,848 --> 01:10:36,408
talked to him on the
telephone? This is ridiculous.

938
01:10:36,484 --> 01:10:38,679
I phoned Princeton.

939
01:10:38,753 --> 01:10:40,584
According to their
housing records,

940
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:42,520
John lived alone.

941
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,896
Now, which is more likely-
that your husband,

942
01:10:48,963 --> 01:10:51,228
a mathematician
with no military training,

943
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,734
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians-

944
01:10:53,802 --> 01:10:55,463
You're making him
sound crazy.

945
01:10:55,538 --> 01:10:58,769
...or, that he has
lost his grip on reality?

946
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,905
Now the only way
I can help him...

947
01:11:02,978 --> 01:11:04,309
is to show him
the difference...

948
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,144
between what's real...

949
01:11:07,216 --> 01:11:09,377
and what is in his mind.

950
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:13,956
Come on.

951
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:17,923
What's he been
working on?

952
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:20,929
His work
is classified.

953
01:11:20,997 --> 01:11:23,261
He mentioned
a supervisor...

954
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,824
by the name
of William Parcher.

955
01:11:25,902 --> 01:11:28,928
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

956
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:31,440
But I can't get to him
without clearances.

957
01:11:32,343 --> 01:11:34,004
You want me to help you get...

958
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:36,103
the details
of my husband's work?

959
01:11:37,515 --> 01:11:39,608
John thinks
I'm a Russian spy.

960
01:11:39,684 --> 01:11:41,652
Is that what
you think?

961
01:11:46,357 --> 01:11:48,791
What did the doctor say? Is he sick?

962
01:11:48,859 --> 01:11:50,486
I don't know.

963
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:52,427
I want to see what John's
been working on.

964
01:11:52,497 --> 01:11:55,466
You know you can't go in his
office. It's classified, Alicia.

965
01:11:55,534 --> 01:11:57,502
Stop. Oh!

966
01:12:10,449 --> 01:12:12,748
Oh, my God.

967
01:12:16,856 --> 01:12:18,790
Oh, my God.

968
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:28,701
Why didn't you
say something?

969
01:12:28,768 --> 01:12:31,829
Alicia,
John's always been...

970
01:12:31,905 --> 01:12:34,237
a little weird.

971
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,503
He said he was
doing code-breaking,

972
01:12:36,577 --> 01:12:38,738
that it was eyes-only.

973
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,804
Top secret, part of the
military effort. Was he?

974
01:12:41,882 --> 01:12:44,350
Well, it was possible, you know?

975
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:45,851
Directives come down
all the time...

976
01:12:45,919 --> 01:12:47,318
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

977
01:12:47,388 --> 01:12:49,856
- It was possible.
- Possible, but...

978
01:12:49,923 --> 01:12:51,721
not likely.

979
01:12:53,428 --> 01:12:56,192
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated...

980
01:12:56,264 --> 01:12:58,425
and then
when you called-

981
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,094
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

982
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:03,501
Cutting out
magazines?

983
01:13:05,106 --> 01:13:07,768
Well, not all.

984
01:14:29,027 --> 01:14:32,429
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

985
01:14:35,735 --> 01:14:37,726
I missed you.
I missed you.

986
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:42,107
I have to talk
to you.

987
01:14:42,175 --> 01:14:44,234
Okay.

988
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:51,510
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

989
01:14:51,584 --> 01:14:55,180
and I do realize
that my behavior...

990
01:14:55,256 --> 01:14:58,350
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you...

991
01:14:58,425 --> 01:15:00,859
must have appeared
insane.

992
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:03,123
I left you
with no other choice.

993
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:05,358
I do understand...

994
01:15:05,432 --> 01:15:08,299
and I'm truly sorry.
That's okay.

995
01:15:09,703 --> 01:15:11,933
Everything's
gonna be all right.

996
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,602
Everything's
gonna be all right.

997
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:18,609
We just have to talk quietly.

998
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:24,346
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

999
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:27,013
I'm gonna tell you
everything now.

1000
01:15:27,088 --> 01:15:29,522
It's breaking
with protocol...

1001
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,525
but you need
to know,

1002
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:35,462
because you have to
help me get out of here.

1003
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:40,192
I've been doing top secret
work for the government.

1004
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:41,998
There's a threat
that exists...

1005
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:44,733
of catastrophic
proportions.

1006
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:47,674
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.

1007
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,109
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

1008
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:52,512
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me...

1009
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:54,881
from doing my work.
You have to get to Wheeler.

1010
01:15:54,952 --> 01:15:57,045
You have to find William Parcher. Stop.

1011
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,021
He can help us.
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1012
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:06,558
I went to Wheeler.

1013
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,291
Good, good.

1014
01:16:08,365 --> 01:16:10,424
There is no
William Parcher.

1015
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,731
Of course there is.

1016
01:16:12,804 --> 01:16:14,863
I've been working for him.
Doing what?

1017
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:17,066
Breaking codes?

1018
01:16:17,141 --> 01:16:19,234
Dropping packages
in a secret mailbox...

1019
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:21,210
for the government
to pick up?

1020
01:16:22,847 --> 01:16:24,610
How could you
know that?

1021
01:16:24,682 --> 01:16:26,809
Sol followed you.

1022
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:30,347
He thought it was
harmless. Sol followed me?

1023
01:16:39,465 --> 01:16:42,059
They've never
been opened.

1024
01:16:44,737 --> 01:16:47,433
It isn't real.

1025
01:16:47,506 --> 01:16:50,737
There is
no conspiracy, John.

1026
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:55,912
There is
no William Parcher.

1027
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,417
It's in your mind.

1028
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:04,616
Do you
understand, baby?

1029
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:07,353
You're sick.

1030
01:17:10,263 --> 01:17:12,595
You're sick, John.

1031
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:16,268
John!

1032
01:17:24,612 --> 01:17:26,273
Code red.

1033
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:32,444
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1034
01:17:43,565 --> 01:17:45,760
John?

1035
01:17:47,436 --> 01:17:49,301
John?

1036
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:53,572
The implant's gone.

1037
01:17:53,643 --> 01:17:56,612
I can't find it.

1038
01:18:00,216 --> 01:18:02,446
It's gone.

1039
01:18:33,618 --> 01:18:36,712
You see, the nightmare
of schizophrenia...

1040
01:18:36,788 --> 01:18:39,120
is not knowing
what's true.

1041
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:41,681
Imagine...

1042
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,923
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places...

1043
01:18:44,996 --> 01:18:47,965
and the moments
most important to you...

1044
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:50,524
were not gone, not dead,

1045
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:53,093
but worse-

1046
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:55,106
had never been.

1047
01:18:57,676 --> 01:19:00,611
What kind of hell
would that be?

1048
01:19:05,718 --> 01:19:07,709
Administering
insulin.

1049
01:19:08,788 --> 01:19:11,052
8:42 AM.

1050
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:10,945
How often?

1051
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:15,457
Five times a week
for 10 weeks.

1052
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:42,211
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

1053
01:20:42,286 --> 01:20:45,016
And Hansen is running
the department now.

1054
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:46,750
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

1055
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:50,191
Yeah.

1056
01:20:50,261 --> 01:20:52,491
John won't come near
the campus, though.

1057
01:20:52,563 --> 01:20:55,499
I think he's ashamed.

1058
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:58,536
Hey. Hey.

1059
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:00,730
Want this?

1060
01:21:00,805 --> 01:21:04,434
So, Alicia, how-
how are you holding up?

1061
01:21:04,509 --> 01:21:07,273
Well, the delusions
have passed.

1062
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:09,609
They're saying
with the medication...

1063
01:21:09,681 --> 01:21:11,273
and low stress
environment-

1064
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:14,147
No, I- I mean,
how are you?

1065
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,690
I think often
what I feel...

1066
01:21:23,763 --> 01:21:26,994
is obligation.

1067
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:32,366
Or guilt
over wanting to leave.

1068
01:21:33,673 --> 01:21:37,872
Rage against John,
against God and-

1069
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,277
But...

1070
01:21:44,318 --> 01:21:46,513
then I look at him...

1071
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:52,387
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

1072
01:21:52,459 --> 01:21:55,258
And he becomes that man.

1073
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:59,733
He's transformed
into someone that I love.

1074
01:22:01,703 --> 01:22:05,230
And I'm transformed
into someone who loves him.

1075
01:22:08,142 --> 01:22:10,110
It's not all the time,

1076
01:22:10,178 --> 01:22:13,011
but...

1077
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:14,810
it's enough.

1078
01:22:14,882 --> 01:22:17,852
I think John is
a very lucky man...

1079
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,581
Alicia.

1080
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:26,923
So unlucky.

1081
01:22:29,932 --> 01:22:32,025
This is us.
This is it?

1082
01:22:32,101 --> 01:22:34,797
It's nice.
It's near where I work.

1083
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,362
John? You've a visitor.

1084
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:43,637
Hi.

1085
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:45,578
I hope it's okay.

1086
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,614
Hey ya, chief.

1087
01:22:54,691 --> 01:22:58,651
- Cigarette?
- Ah, no, thanks.

1088
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:00,788
I quit, actually.

1089
01:23:04,468 --> 01:23:06,800
Hello.
Hey, John.

1090
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,698
Have you met
Harvey?

1091
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:12,208
Umm, I...

1092
01:23:13,577 --> 01:23:15,477
- John, there's no-
- Relax, it's okay.

1093
01:23:15,546 --> 01:23:18,175
There's no point in being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

1094
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,241
Jesus Christ, John.

1095
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:21,946
I should have known.

1096
01:23:23,422 --> 01:23:25,287
Here you go.

1097
01:23:26,825 --> 01:23:28,759
I can take those later.

1098
01:23:28,827 --> 01:23:30,385
You're supposed
to take them now.

1099
01:23:31,763 --> 01:23:35,096
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

1100
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:36,658
Okay.

1101
01:23:39,572 --> 01:23:42,200
So, um... yeah.
I- I was in town...

1102
01:23:42,275 --> 01:23:44,436
giving a workshop.

1103
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,501
I go back tonight.

1104
01:23:46,579 --> 01:23:48,843
You know, Bender,
he really wanted...

1105
01:23:48,915 --> 01:23:53,443
to stop by and you know,
see you. You know, say hi.

1106
01:23:53,519 --> 01:23:55,180
Squeamish?

1107
01:23:55,254 --> 01:23:57,689
Yeah.

1108
01:23:57,758 --> 01:24:00,226
I suppose
I would be, too.

1109
01:24:00,294 --> 01:24:02,285
But alas,
I'm stuck with me.

1110
01:24:05,766 --> 01:24:08,963
I'm trying to solve the
Reimann hypothesis. Uh-huh.

1111
01:24:10,471 --> 01:24:12,439
Oh, yeah?

1112
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:15,634
I figured if-
if I dazzle them,

1113
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:17,871
they will have
to reinstate me.

1114
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:22,974
But it's difficult
with the medication,

1115
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:26,487
because it's hard to...

1116
01:24:28,556 --> 01:24:30,114
see the solution.

1117
01:24:38,634 --> 01:24:41,432
You know, John,
you should go easy.

1118
01:24:41,504 --> 01:24:44,496
There are other
things besides-

1119
01:24:44,573 --> 01:24:45,870
besides work.

1120
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:50,403
What are they?

1121
01:25:08,365 --> 01:25:10,356
Shh-hh.

1122
01:25:11,368 --> 01:25:13,336
Shh.

1123
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:28,408
What are you
thinking about?

1124
01:25:31,589 --> 01:25:33,523
What do people do?

1125
01:25:33,591 --> 01:25:36,025
It's life, John.

1126
01:25:36,093 --> 01:25:38,062
Activities available,

1127
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:40,724
just add meaning.

1128
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,301
You could try
leaving the house.

1129
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:53,811
You know, maybe...

1130
01:25:53,879 --> 01:25:55,972
talk to people.

1131
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:02,952
You could try
taking out the garbage.

1132
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:27,740
And there's some more-
there's some more in...

1133
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,562
Who- Who were
you talking to?

1134
01:26:42,631 --> 01:26:44,690
Garbage man.

1135
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:56,534
Garbage men don't come
at night.

1136
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:01,340
I guess around here
they do.

1137
01:27:27,644 --> 01:27:29,737
Sorry.

1138
01:28:35,749 --> 01:28:38,446
Is it the medication?

1139
01:29:18,928 --> 01:29:21,362
I don't know
what to do.

1140
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:42,050
My mother's going to keep the
baby a little longer tonight.

1141
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,447
I can get three hours
of overtime.

1142
01:30:11,483 --> 01:30:13,474
I'm going to bed.

1143
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:23,094
- Good night.
- Good night.

1144
01:31:41,177 --> 01:31:43,737
It’s good to see you, John.

1145
01:31:44,914 --> 01:31:46,905
It's been a while.

1146
01:31:46,983 --> 01:31:48,951
Parcher?

1147
01:31:49,018 --> 01:31:51,111
Yes, sir.

1148
01:31:54,624 --> 01:31:56,114
You're not real!

1149
01:31:56,192 --> 01:31:58,956
Of course I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

1150
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,991
I don't think that I would
go that way, John.

1151
01:32:07,504 --> 01:32:09,870
It’s time for you
to get back to work.

1152
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,932
The bomb is in
its final position...

1153
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,500
here in the U.S.

1154
01:32:15,846 --> 01:32:17,711
Knowing
your situation...

1155
01:32:17,781 --> 01:32:20,444
requires you keep a
low profile, "Mohammed,"

1156
01:32:20,518 --> 01:32:23,646
we've brought
the mountain to you.

1157
01:32:42,675 --> 01:32:45,439
We've narrowed the bomb's
location to somewhere...

1158
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:47,308
on the eastern seaboard.

1159
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:52,010
But we haven't been able
to pinpoint its exact position.

1160
01:32:54,353 --> 01:32:56,981
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1161
01:32:59,692 --> 01:33:01,888
Here, look at this, John.

1162
01:33:04,364 --> 01:33:07,564
What?

1163
01:33:10,203 --> 01:33:13,798
- Dr. Rosen said-
- Rosen! That quack!

1164
01:33:13,874 --> 01:33:15,808
"Schizophrenic break
from reality," right?

1165
01:33:15,876 --> 01:33:17,810
Psychological bullshit!

1166
01:33:17,878 --> 01:33:19,869
Look at me, John.

1167
01:33:19,947 --> 01:33:22,348
John, look at me.

1168
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:26,109
Do I look
like I'm imagined?

1169
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:30,548
Wheeler has
no record of you.

1170
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:33,093
Do you think we list
our personnel?

1171
01:33:35,229 --> 01:33:38,392
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1172
01:33:38,466 --> 01:33:41,903
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1173
01:33:41,971 --> 01:33:44,701
I can restore
your status at Wheeler.

1174
01:33:44,773 --> 01:33:47,469
I can let the world
know what you did.

1175
01:33:47,543 --> 01:33:50,103
But I need you now, soldier.

1176
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:58,485
I was so scared
you weren't real.

1177
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:08,764
There's a storm
coming.

1178
01:34:08,832 --> 01:34:11,096
I'm just going to grab
the laundry, okay?

1179
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:13,158
I'll draw his bath.

1180
01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:18,236
It's okay.

1181
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:21,441
Okay.

1182
01:35:59,948 --> 01:36:01,883
John?

1183
01:36:07,756 --> 01:36:10,520
I've almost got it! Charles,
you just watch the baby.

1184
01:36:10,593 --> 01:36:11,753
I've got one more to close!

1185
01:36:11,827 --> 01:36:13,761
- No!
- I'll be right there.

1186
01:36:13,829 --> 01:36:16,491
Oh, God.

1187
01:36:18,534 --> 01:36:21,264
I need a towel.

1188
01:36:21,337 --> 01:36:24,466
Shhh.

1189
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:26,202
Charles was watching him.
He was okay.

1190
01:36:26,276 --> 01:36:28,073
There is no one here.

1191
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:31,413
- Charles was watching him.
- There is no one here!

1192
01:36:31,448 --> 01:36:33,348
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1193
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:35,211
I can see him
because of a chemical...

1194
01:36:35,285 --> 01:36:37,412
that was released
into my bloodstream...

1195
01:36:37,487 --> 01:36:39,955
when my implant dissolved.

1196
01:36:41,592 --> 01:36:43,560
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!

1197
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:45,891
Alicia!

1198
01:36:51,569 --> 01:36:55,061
- No!
- Hello, I need Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1199
01:36:55,139 --> 01:36:56,834
You've got
to stop her, John.

1200
01:36:58,176 --> 01:37:00,440
You leave her out of this.

1201
01:37:02,181 --> 01:37:04,877
- Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.

1202
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:07,248
- John.
- She'll compromise us again.

1203
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:09,685
- No, she won't.
- You'll go back to the hospital.

1204
01:37:09,755 --> 01:37:11,848
- John, answer me!
- Countless people will die.

1205
01:37:11,924 --> 01:37:13,585
Alicia, please,
put the phone down.

1206
01:37:13,659 --> 01:37:16,253
- I can't let that happen.
- Yes, hello?

1207
01:37:16,328 --> 01:37:18,592
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen.
Is he in?

1208
01:37:18,664 --> 01:37:21,132
I'm sorry, John.

1209
01:37:22,168 --> 01:37:23,795
No-oo!

1210
01:37:26,339 --> 01:37:28,102
Alicia?

1211
01:37:28,174 --> 01:37:30,108
You know
what you have to do, Nash.

1212
01:37:30,176 --> 01:37:31,609
- Get away from me.
- She's too great a risk.

1213
01:37:31,678 --> 01:37:33,908
Get away!

1214
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:36,005
I didn't mean
to hurt you!

1215
01:37:37,684 --> 01:37:41,176
Finish her.
She knows too much now.

1216
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,625
Uncle John?

1217
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,684
Take care of her,
you pathetic piece of shit,

1218
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:49,092
or I'll take care of you.

1219
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:50,630
John,

1220
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:53,326
Christ, John,
please do what he says.

1221
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,164
Move, soldier.

1222
01:37:56,237 --> 01:37:57,704
Now.

1223
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:58,999
Uncle John?

1224
01:37:59,073 --> 01:38:01,701
John, please!

1225
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:04,845
Now!

1226
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:06,813
Alicia and Charles never
coexist in the same...

1227
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,712
interactive field.
Alicia and Parcher...

1228
01:38:15,957 --> 01:38:18,187
Let's play!

1229
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:20,956
...Charles, and Marcee cannot
coexist with Alicia.

1230
01:38:21,029 --> 01:38:22,725
I understand.

1231
01:38:39,048 --> 01:38:41,039
She never gets old.

1232
01:38:43,754 --> 01:38:47,246
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1233
01:39:19,991 --> 01:39:21,583
You see them now?

1234
01:39:30,836 --> 01:39:32,531
Yes.

1235
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,138
Why did you
stop your meds?

1236
01:39:39,378 --> 01:39:41,744
Because I couldn't
do my work.

1237
01:39:41,814 --> 01:39:43,749
I couldn't help
with the baby.

1238
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:45,546
I couldn't-

1239
01:39:47,053 --> 01:39:49,283
I couldn't respond
to my wife.

1240
01:39:51,624 --> 01:39:53,956
You think that's better
than being crazy?

1241
01:39:54,027 --> 01:39:57,121
We'll need to start you
on a higher run...

1242
01:39:57,197 --> 01:39:59,165
of insulin shocks
and a new medication.

1243
01:39:59,232 --> 01:40:00,893
No.

1244
01:40:00,967 --> 01:40:02,798
There has
to be another way.

1245
01:40:02,869 --> 01:40:07,239
Schizophrenia is degenerative.
Some days may be symptom-free,

1246
01:40:07,308 --> 01:40:08,969
but over time,
you are getting worse.

1247
01:40:09,043 --> 01:40:12,103
It's a problem.
That's all it is.

1248
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,977
It's a problem
with no solution.

1249
01:40:15,049 --> 01:40:16,812
And that's what I do,
I solve problems.

1250
01:40:16,884 --> 01:40:18,511
That's what I do best.
This isn't math.

1251
01:40:18,586 --> 01:40:20,349
You can't come up
with a formula...

1252
01:40:20,421 --> 01:40:22,412
to change the way
you experience the world.

1253
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:25,255
- All I have to do is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.

1254
01:40:25,327 --> 01:40:28,023
- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't I?

1255
01:40:28,096 --> 01:40:30,894
Because your mind is where the
problem is in the first place.

1256
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:35,131
I can do this.

1257
01:40:35,203 --> 01:40:38,832
I can work it out.
All I need is time.

1258
01:40:41,877 --> 01:40:44,346
Is that the baby?

1259
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:48,607
The baby's at my mother’s, John.

1260
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:05,201
Without treatment, John,

1261
01:41:05,269 --> 01:41:07,203
the fantasies
may take over...

1262
01:41:08,205 --> 01:41:09,729
entirely.

1263
01:41:27,559 --> 01:41:29,823
You almost ready?

1264
01:41:31,796 --> 01:41:34,162
Rosen's waiting outside.

1265
01:41:34,232 --> 01:41:36,928
I can't go back
to that hospital.

1266
01:41:40,939 --> 01:41:42,998
I won't come home.

1267
01:41:46,512 --> 01:41:48,742
He said that
if you said that,

1268
01:41:49,482 --> 01:41:53,248
he has commitment
papers for me to sign.

1269
01:41:55,621 --> 01:41:57,350
Well, maybe you
won't sign them.

1270
01:41:59,191 --> 01:42:01,250
Maybe you'll just
give me some time.

1271
01:42:04,164 --> 01:42:06,155
I will try
to figure this out.

1272
01:42:08,535 --> 01:42:10,400
Whatever you do,

1273
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:13,769
Rosen is right
about one thing.

1274
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,365
You shouldn't be here.

1275
01:42:18,778 --> 01:42:20,678
I'm not safe anymore.

1276
01:42:26,354 --> 01:42:28,345
Would you have
hurt me, John?

1277
01:42:37,732 --> 01:42:39,393
I don't know.

1278
01:42:41,502 --> 01:42:44,164
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen
drive you to your mother's.

1279
01:43:50,108 --> 01:43:53,600
Rosen said to call if you try
and kill me or anything.

1280
01:44:09,962 --> 01:44:12,260
You want to know
what's real?

1281
01:44:17,737 --> 01:44:19,671
This.

1282
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:28,948
This.

1283
01:44:34,254 --> 01:44:36,154
This.

1284
01:44:37,591 --> 01:44:39,752
This is real.

1285
01:44:43,096 --> 01:44:45,463
Maybe the part...

1286
01:44:45,533 --> 01:44:47,933
that knows the waking
from the dream,

1287
01:44:49,337 --> 01:44:51,271
maybe it isn't here.

1288
01:44:55,143 --> 01:44:57,611
Maybe it's here.

1289
01:45:02,283 --> 01:45:04,615
I need to believe...

1290
01:45:04,686 --> 01:45:08,123
that something
extraordinary is possible.

1291
01:46:10,889 --> 01:46:12,618
Come.

1292
01:46:21,099 --> 01:46:22,964
Hello, Martin.

1293
01:46:27,573 --> 01:46:29,803
Jesus Christ.

1294
01:46:31,477 --> 01:46:33,138
No. I-

1295
01:46:33,212 --> 01:46:36,238
I don't have that one.
My savior complex...

1296
01:46:36,315 --> 01:46:37,748
takes on a completely
different form.

1297
01:46:39,619 --> 01:46:42,713
I heard what happened
and well,

1298
01:46:42,789 --> 01:46:45,223
I- I wanted to write
and I tried you at MacArthur's...

1299
01:46:45,291 --> 01:46:47,385
but you'd left, and I just...

1300
01:46:59,473 --> 01:47:01,532
This is Helinger's old office.

1301
01:47:01,608 --> 01:47:03,200
Yeah.

1302
01:47:03,277 --> 01:47:05,768
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1303
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:10,617
Seems that you won
after all, Martin.

1304
01:47:11,986 --> 01:47:14,955
They were wrong, John.
No one wins.

1305
01:47:15,023 --> 01:47:17,753
Please, please have a seat.

1306
01:47:17,826 --> 01:47:20,761
God, it's so good
to see you.

1307
01:47:22,864 --> 01:47:25,264
What brings you
back to Princeton?

1308
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:26,699
John?

1309
01:47:26,769 --> 01:47:29,966
John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.

1310
01:47:30,039 --> 01:47:32,132
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1311
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:33,800
Tell him your work is critical.

1312
01:47:33,876 --> 01:47:36,140
John, please!

1313
01:47:49,726 --> 01:47:53,287
Is there any chance that you
could ignore what I just did?

1314
01:47:54,965 --> 01:47:57,832
Of course,
what are old friends for?

1315
01:47:57,901 --> 01:48:01,564
Is that what we are, Martin?
Friends?

1316
01:48:01,638 --> 01:48:03,731
John, of course.

1317
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:06,537
Of course.
We always have been.

1318
01:48:11,749 --> 01:48:13,683
Alicia and I think that-

1319
01:48:13,751 --> 01:48:15,582
that fitting in,

1320
01:48:15,653 --> 01:48:17,644
being part of a community,

1321
01:48:19,924 --> 01:48:21,687
might do me some good.

1322
01:48:21,759 --> 01:48:23,659
That a certain level
of attachment,

1323
01:48:23,728 --> 01:48:25,719
familiar places,
familiar people,

1324
01:48:27,232 --> 01:48:28,995
might help me...

1325
01:48:29,067 --> 01:48:31,558
elbow out these-

1326
01:48:34,907 --> 01:48:37,876
these certain delusions
that I have.

1327
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:45,209
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1328
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,781
I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.

1329
01:48:53,092 --> 01:48:55,890
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1330
01:49:04,604 --> 01:49:06,071
Huh.

1331
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:12,271
Will you be needing an office?

1332
01:49:16,617 --> 01:49:18,448
No.

1333
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:24,189
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1334
01:49:24,258 --> 01:49:26,818
Well, this guy tries
to wander into the library,

1335
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:30,058
but he doesn't have I.D. Why
can't people read their memos, huh?

1336
01:49:30,131 --> 01:49:31,860
Then he goes
totally nuts.

1337
01:49:31,933 --> 01:49:34,163
Not real! You're not real.

1338
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:36,100
There's no mission.

1339
01:49:36,171 --> 01:49:38,469
Oh, shit. Shit.

1340
01:49:39,607 --> 01:49:42,269
Not real!
You are not real!

1341
01:49:42,344 --> 01:49:44,244
Is this what you are, soldier?

1342
01:49:44,312 --> 01:49:45,574
Some useless ghoul?

1343
01:49:45,647 --> 01:49:47,673
The local madman?

1344
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:50,378
I'm not a soldier. You're
gonna end up in a cell!

1345
01:49:50,453 --> 01:49:52,717
Old, worthless,
discarded.

1346
01:49:52,788 --> 01:49:54,016
There's no mission.

1347
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:55,717
And while you rock
and drool,

1348
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:57,349
the world will
burn to ashes!

1349
01:49:57,426 --> 01:49:59,860
You are not real!
You are not real!

1350
01:49:59,929 --> 01:50:01,590
You're still talking
to me, soldier.

1351
01:50:01,664 --> 01:50:04,963
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1352
01:50:05,034 --> 01:50:06,695
John? John?

1353
01:50:06,769 --> 01:50:08,601
John, John, John, John.

1354
01:50:08,672 --> 01:50:10,037
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1355
01:50:10,107 --> 01:50:11,631
John, John!
It's okay.

1356
01:50:11,708 --> 01:50:13,869
I just heard what happened,
I'm sorry. John-

1357
01:50:13,944 --> 01:50:16,105
I'm not a soldier.
John. Hey, Nash.

1358
01:50:16,179 --> 01:50:19,615
Nash, hey.
Hey, you're all right.

1359
01:50:21,151 --> 01:50:23,278
Nash, Nash,
hey, hey, hey.

1360
01:50:27,024 --> 01:50:29,926
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1361
01:50:29,994 --> 01:50:31,154
John?

1362
01:50:33,297 --> 01:50:35,925
You should've seen their faces.

1363
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,730
Everybody was
just staring at me.

1364
01:50:38,803 --> 01:50:40,430
John...

1365
01:50:40,505 --> 01:50:43,668
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1366
01:50:43,741 --> 01:50:45,971
I know.

1367
01:50:48,213 --> 01:50:50,306
But then,
on the way home,

1368
01:50:50,382 --> 01:50:53,215
Charles was there.

1369
01:50:57,056 --> 01:51:00,389
Sometimes, I really miss
talking to him.

1370
01:51:03,328 --> 01:51:05,694
Maybe Rosen's right.

1371
01:51:05,764 --> 01:51:09,292
Maybe I have to think about going
back into the hospital again.

1372
01:51:09,369 --> 01:51:11,337
No.

1373
01:51:11,404 --> 01:51:13,668
Come here.

1374
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:19,843
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1375
01:51:43,904 --> 01:51:47,305
John, now, you can't
ignore me forever.

1376
01:51:52,614 --> 01:51:54,844
Charles, you've been
a very good friend to me.

1377
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:56,577
The best.

1378
01:51:58,286 --> 01:52:01,050
But I won't talk to you again.

1379
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:06,587
I just can't.

1380
01:52:11,834 --> 01:52:14,359
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1381
01:52:22,178 --> 01:52:23,839
Good-bye.

1382
01:52:30,988 --> 01:52:32,819
Good-bye.

1383
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:49,262
I was wondering if I might
audit your course.

1384
01:52:50,675 --> 01:52:53,667
It's- It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

1385
01:52:56,881 --> 01:52:58,974
Is something wrong?

1386
01:53:00,285 --> 01:53:02,583
This will be
my first class.

1387
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:08,584
Good morning,

1388
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:10,856
eager young minds.

1389
01:53:30,684 --> 01:53:32,982
It's never
gonna work, John.

1390
01:53:33,053 --> 01:53:35,544
You're just
humiliating yourself.

1391
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:40,285
It's pathetic!

1392
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:42,419
You are being
pathetic.

1393
01:53:42,495 --> 01:53:44,486
I'm ashamed of you.

1394
01:54:11,727 --> 01:54:13,786
Oh, man!

1395
01:54:17,532 --> 01:54:20,524
Are you coming?
You're gonna be late.

1396
01:54:23,305 --> 01:54:25,170
Dad, you've got my books.
What?

1397
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,867
You've got my books.

1398
01:54:26,942 --> 01:54:29,377
Oh, right.

1399
01:54:29,445 --> 01:54:30,878
Thanks.

1400
01:54:31,914 --> 01:54:33,643
Good-bye.
Bye.

1401
01:54:33,716 --> 01:54:35,513
See you tonight.

1402
01:54:35,585 --> 01:54:37,553
Bye, honey.

1403
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:11,643
Did you just solve Reimann?

1404
01:56:11,719 --> 01:56:13,914
Well, what
do you think?

1405
01:56:13,988 --> 01:56:17,014
Huh. That's an analog to Frobenius...

1406
01:56:17,091 --> 01:56:19,082
for non-commutative
extensions.

1407
01:56:20,261 --> 01:56:22,525
Yes, it is.

1408
01:56:22,597 --> 01:56:25,589
But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.

1409
01:56:25,666 --> 01:56:27,793
But...

1410
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:30,167
I believe I'm
making progress.

1411
01:56:31,206 --> 01:56:33,174
You're-

1412
01:56:33,242 --> 01:56:36,075
You're John Nash, right?

1413
01:56:38,547 --> 01:56:40,640
Toby Kelly.
Hello.

1414
01:56:40,716 --> 01:56:42,513
I've been studying
your equilibrium.

1415
01:56:42,584 --> 01:56:44,609
The one you wrote
here, at Princeton.

1416
01:56:44,686 --> 01:56:47,177
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.

1417
01:56:47,256 --> 01:56:48,689
You know, I was young.

1418
01:56:48,757 --> 01:56:50,315
Umm...

1419
01:56:50,393 --> 01:56:52,759
I've been developing
a theory.

1420
01:57:07,076 --> 01:57:09,237
I believe I can prove...

1421
01:57:09,312 --> 01:57:12,077
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1422
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:14,549
That everything,
everything is connected.

1423
01:57:14,618 --> 01:57:17,280
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1424
01:57:18,489 --> 01:57:20,389
When was the last time
you ate?

1425
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:23,018
Excuse me?
You know, food.

1426
01:57:23,093 --> 01:57:25,061
Oh, uh-

1427
01:57:25,129 --> 01:57:27,097
My wife,

1428
01:57:27,164 --> 01:57:29,029
she loves mayonnaise.

1429
01:57:29,099 --> 01:57:32,331
Oh, thank you.

1430
01:57:32,404 --> 01:57:33,598
Thank you.

1431
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:36,504
Go on.

1432
01:57:36,575 --> 01:57:38,668
The function...

1433
01:57:38,743 --> 01:57:40,677
is in the two categories.
Um-hmm.

1434
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:49,247
Alicia!

1435
01:57:49,321 --> 01:57:52,519
...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1436
01:57:52,592 --> 01:57:54,685
let us say
10 miles per hour.

1437
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:58,059
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle B,

1438
01:57:58,130 --> 01:58:01,099
and the fly, who can travel
at 20 miles an hour,

1439
01:58:01,167 --> 01:58:02,794
leaves the tire
of bicycle B and it flies...

1440
01:58:02,869 --> 01:58:05,030
to the tire of bicycle A
and backwards and forwards...

1441
01:58:05,104 --> 01:58:07,436
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide...

1442
01:58:07,507 --> 01:58:09,270
and the poor little fly
is squashed.

1443
01:58:09,342 --> 01:58:11,470
This is the important thing...

1444
01:58:11,545 --> 01:58:13,604
about actually focusing in
and comprehending...

1445
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,705
the area that you're
dealing with.

1446
01:58:15,782 --> 01:58:18,615
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1447
01:58:18,685 --> 01:58:20,983
no matter what these people
around here will tell you,

1448
01:58:21,054 --> 01:58:22,487
especially the people
from biology.

1449
01:58:22,556 --> 01:58:24,114
Don't listen to any
of those people.

1450
01:58:24,191 --> 01:58:26,489
Let me go back
to what you were doing before.

1451
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,859
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1452
01:58:31,132 --> 01:58:33,293
I was thinking
that I might teach.

1453
01:58:34,702 --> 01:58:36,795
A classroom
with 50 students...

1454
01:58:36,871 --> 01:58:39,840
can be daunting
for anyone.

1455
01:58:39,908 --> 01:58:42,741
John, besides, you're
a terrible teacher.

1456
01:58:43,912 --> 01:58:46,745
I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

1457
01:58:46,814 --> 01:58:49,783
I was hoping there still might
be something I could contribute.

1458
01:58:49,851 --> 01:58:51,820
What about the-

1459
01:58:51,887 --> 01:58:53,980
Well, you know.

1460
01:58:54,056 --> 01:58:56,388
Are they gone?

1461
01:59:02,398 --> 01:59:05,333
No, they're not gone.

1462
01:59:05,401 --> 01:59:06,993
And maybe they
never will be.

1463
01:59:07,069 --> 01:59:08,832
But I've gotten used
to ignoring them...

1464
01:59:08,904 --> 01:59:12,306
and I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1465
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:14,309
You think that's
what it's like...

1466
01:59:14,377 --> 01:59:18,040
with all our dreams
and our nightmares, Martin?

1467
01:59:18,114 --> 01:59:21,174
You've got to keep feeding
them for them to stay alive?

1468
01:59:21,251 --> 01:59:24,709
John, they-
haunt you, though.

1469
01:59:24,788 --> 01:59:29,521
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1470
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:34,464
Well, good-bye.

1471
01:59:34,532 --> 01:59:36,966
John, I'll talk
to the department.

1472
01:59:38,936 --> 01:59:40,767
Maybe
in the spring.

1473
01:59:46,377 --> 01:59:48,208
Hey, Nash?

1474
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:53,908
You- You scared?

1475
01:59:56,388 --> 01:59:58,322
Terrified.

1476
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:00,756
Mortified.
Petrified.

1477
02:00:00,826 --> 02:00:03,556
Stupefied by you.

1478
02:00:03,629 --> 02:00:04,994
Now you ought best
ring Alicia,

1479
02:00:05,063 --> 02:00:07,156
or you're gonna get me...
I'll ring her.

1480
02:00:07,232 --> 02:00:08,563
in an awful
lot of trouble.

1481
02:00:12,472 --> 02:00:14,235
Thanks, Professor.
Good-bye.

1482
02:00:14,307 --> 02:00:16,241
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.

1483
02:00:16,309 --> 02:00:19,176
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.

1484
02:00:19,245 --> 02:00:21,236
Professor Nash?

1485
02:00:24,484 --> 02:00:27,078
Can you see him?
Yeah.

1486
02:00:27,153 --> 02:00:28,745
You sure?
Uh-huh.

1487
02:00:28,821 --> 02:00:31,016
Positive?
He's within your vision?

1488
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:32,683
Okay. Good.

1489
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:35,752
Forgive me, I'm just
always suspicious of new people.

1490
02:00:35,829 --> 02:00:38,161
See you next week,
Professor. See you next week.

1491
02:00:39,466 --> 02:00:41,093
So now that I know
that you're real,

1492
02:00:41,168 --> 02:00:43,636
who are you, and what can I do for you?

1493
02:00:43,704 --> 02:00:47,105
Professor, my name
is Thomas King...

1494
02:00:47,174 --> 02:00:48,300
Thomas King?
Mm-hm.

1495
02:00:48,375 --> 02:00:49,865
and I'm here
to tell you...

1496
02:00:49,943 --> 02:00:52,970
that you're being considered
for the Nobel Prize.

1497
02:01:00,522 --> 02:01:03,252
Forgive me, but I'm just
a little stunned.

1498
02:01:03,324 --> 02:01:05,792
Over the past few years
your equilibrium...

1499
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:08,454
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1500
02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:10,794
Suddenly everybody
likes that one.

1501
02:01:10,865 --> 02:01:15,166
What about my work on other some such projects
- manifold embedding?

1502
02:01:15,237 --> 02:01:18,468
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1503
02:01:18,541 --> 02:01:22,841
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases-

1504
02:01:22,912 --> 02:01:24,641
Antitrust cases?
Yes.

1505
02:01:24,714 --> 02:01:27,012
I never would have
considered that.

1506
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:28,675
Well...
Have I just reached...

1507
02:01:28,751 --> 02:01:31,481
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1508
02:01:31,554 --> 02:01:33,455
No, no, you haven't.

1509
02:01:33,523 --> 02:01:35,514
'Cause, I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1510
02:01:40,664 --> 02:01:42,723
Shall we have tea?

1511
02:01:44,701 --> 02:01:47,033
Oh, I don't go in there.
I usually just...

1512
02:01:47,104 --> 02:01:49,004
take my sandwich
in the library.

1513
02:01:49,072 --> 02:01:53,032
Come on, John. Let's have
some tea. It's a big day.

1514
02:01:53,111 --> 02:01:55,170
M- Most-

1515
02:01:55,246 --> 02:01:57,146
Most commercially
available brands of tea...

1516
02:01:57,215 --> 02:01:58,842
are not suitable
to my palate.

1517
02:01:58,916 --> 02:02:00,645
I'm not-

1518
02:02:00,718 --> 02:02:03,846
There are some Northern Indian
teas which are dense enough-

1519
02:02:03,921 --> 02:02:06,515
I enjoy the flavor
that they have-

1520
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:08,320
I have not been
in this room...

1521
02:02:08,392 --> 02:02:11,384
for some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1522
02:02:13,065 --> 02:02:14,692
Why, thank you,
young lady.

1523
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:19,401
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1524
02:02:19,471 --> 02:02:21,735
I have a son that age.

1525
02:02:21,807 --> 02:02:24,776
Harvard.

1526
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:30,073
Hmm.

1527
02:02:30,149 --> 02:02:32,709
I would have thought
the nominations...

1528
02:02:32,785 --> 02:02:35,254
for the Nobel Prize
would have been secret.

1529
02:02:35,321 --> 02:02:37,084
I would have thought
you'd only find out...

1530
02:02:37,157 --> 02:02:38,749
if you won or lost.

1531
02:02:38,825 --> 02:02:41,020
That is generally
the case, yes.

1532
02:02:41,094 --> 02:02:43,221
But these are
special circumstances.

1533
02:02:44,497 --> 02:02:46,829
The awards
are substantial.

1534
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:51,428
They require private funding. As such,

1535
02:02:51,504 --> 02:02:54,497
the image
of the Nobel is...

1536
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:58,840
I see. You came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1537
02:03:00,114 --> 02:03:02,344
Find out if I would...

1538
02:03:02,416 --> 02:03:04,407
screw everything up
if I actually won?

1539
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:09,084
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken,

1540
02:03:09,156 --> 02:03:10,555
things of this nature?

1541
02:03:10,624 --> 02:03:13,092
Something
like that, yes.

1542
02:03:14,095 --> 02:03:16,086
Would I
embarrass you?

1543
02:03:19,634 --> 02:03:21,761
Yes, it is possible.

1544
02:03:24,506 --> 02:03:26,599
You see, I-

1545
02:03:27,342 --> 02:03:29,640
I am crazy.

1546
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:33,808
I take the newer
medications,

1547
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:40,212
but I still see things
that are not here.

1548
02:03:42,458 --> 02:03:44,653
I just choose
not to acknowledge them.

1549
02:03:46,796 --> 02:03:48,627
Like a diet of the mind,

1550
02:03:48,698 --> 02:03:51,132
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1551
02:03:53,537 --> 02:03:56,404
Like my appetite
for patterns.

1552
02:03:58,041 --> 02:04:02,000
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

1553
02:04:03,046 --> 02:04:04,980
Professor Nash.

1554
02:04:09,086 --> 02:04:12,522
It's good to have
you here, John.

1555
02:04:12,589 --> 02:04:14,524
Thank you.

1556
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:23,167
It's an honor, sir.
Thank you very much.

1557
02:04:23,234 --> 02:04:24,929
A privilege,
Professor.

1558
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,707
Professor.

1559
02:04:36,081 --> 02:04:39,073
Nicely done, John.
Thank you, Tom.

1560
02:04:40,252 --> 02:04:44,783
Thank you.

1561
02:04:52,898 --> 02:04:55,197
Thank you, Ed.

1562
02:05:02,776 --> 02:05:05,711
That was certainly
most unexpected.

1563
02:05:26,734 --> 02:05:28,964
Thank you.

1564
02:05:33,074 --> 02:05:35,407
I've always believed in numbers.

1565
02:05:35,477 --> 02:05:38,037
In the equations and logics...

1566
02:05:38,113 --> 02:05:40,047
that lead to reason.

1567
02:05:40,115 --> 02:05:43,016
But after a lifetime
of such pursuits,

1568
02:05:43,085 --> 02:05:45,576
I ask,

1569
02:05:45,654 --> 02:05:48,214
what truly is logic?

1570
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:51,418
Who decides reason?

1571
02:05:52,861 --> 02:05:56,298
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1572
02:05:56,366 --> 02:05:58,266
the metaphysical,

1573
02:05:59,702 --> 02:06:01,670
the delusional...

1574
02:06:02,805 --> 02:06:04,796
and back.

1575
02:06:06,876 --> 02:06:09,709
And I have made the most
important discovery of my career.

1576
02:06:11,681 --> 02:06:14,981
The most important discovery
of my life.

1577
02:06:17,454 --> 02:06:21,049
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love...

1578
02:06:21,125 --> 02:06:24,117
that any logical
reasons can be found.

1579
02:06:27,531 --> 02:06:30,796
I'm only here tonight
because of you.

1580
02:06:32,036 --> 02:06:35,029
You are
the reason I am.

1581
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:41,543
You are all my reasons.

1582
02:06:45,383 --> 02:06:47,476
Thank you.

1583
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:43,577
So nice to have
met you.

1584
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:48,077
I'll call
for the car, Dad.

1585
02:07:48,149 --> 02:07:51,378
Bye bye.

1586
02:07:51,452 --> 02:07:54,387
Are you ready to go now?
Oh, yes, I am.

1587
02:07:54,455 --> 02:07:57,016
Yes, indeed,
and yes, please.

1588
02:07:57,092 --> 02:07:59,890
Thank you so much.

02:07:59,962 --> 02:08:01,293
Thank you.

1590
02:08:03,832 --> 02:08:06,062
What is it?
What's wrong?

1591
02:08:09,838 --> 02:08:11,669
Nothing.

1592
02:08:13,342 --> 02:08:14,673
Nothing at all.

1593
02:08:16,646 --> 02:08:19,274
Come with me, young lady. Oh-hh...

1594
02:08:19,349 --> 02:08:21,840
I have a car outside.

1595
02:08:21,918 --> 02:08:24,409
Are you interested
in a ride?

1596
02:08:25,455 --> 02:08:27,184
Where's it going to?

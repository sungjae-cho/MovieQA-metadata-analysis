1
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,088
Okay, stand by, everyone.

2
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,841
Five, four, three, two...

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,406
At 52 minutes past the hour
on this Thursday morning, welcome back.

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,691
Joining me now is
author Bill Bryson.

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,287
So, travel writing.

6
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,811
I'm sorry, is that a question?

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,260
NoÃ«l Coward once said,
"Why do the wrong people travel,

8
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,168
"and the right people stay at home?"

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,402
Now, tell us about this
Collector's Edition Box Set.

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,968
"An elegant reissue of
old favorites."

11
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,881
Riveting stuff.

12
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,808
Now, in your books, you've written
about Europe, Australia, the British Isles.

13
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,484
You actually lived there briefly.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,329
Briefly. 10 years.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,841
Mmm, but never America.

16
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,340
You've never written
about your home country.

17
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,001
- No, that's not exactly right...
- Why? Why nothing more personal?

18
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,805
I see. So you've moved back,
or is that just temporary?

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,365
No. Yes. My family, we moved back.
To New Hampshire.

20
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,441
Twenty years ago.
And... And we're still here.

21
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,769
"Still"? Interesting choice of words.

22
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,099
Uh, what else are you working on?
Are you writing something new?

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,281
No.

24
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,283
Not thinking of retiring on us, are you?

25
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,939
No, writers don't retire.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,043
We either drink ourselves to death
or blow our brains out.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,965
And which will it be for you?

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,163
After this interview, maybe both.

29
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,883
- Bill Bryson, pleasure to have you with us.
- Ah. Thank you.

30
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,284
Oh!

31
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,683
- Oh. Hello, stranger.
- Hello, yourself.

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,445
How'd it go?

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,920
- You saw?
- Mmm-hmm.

34
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,844
- That good, huh?
- Hey, Gramps.

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,043
- Hi.
- I saw, too.

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,281
- Oh, yeah? How'd I look?
- Do you want my honest answer?

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,401
Never mind.

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,127
- Gramps, I made it to level six.
- Level six? Way to go.

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,849
Did you get my message
about Earl McGregor?

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,764
Services are on Saturday morning.

41
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,006
Can't we just send flowers?

42
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,006
We could.

43
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,691
You two, hands washed,
dinner's nearly ready. Let's go.

44
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,725
Makes you think about slowing down,
doesn't it?

45
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,807
I'm so, so sorry. My condolences.

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,259
Deborah, we're so sorry.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,920
Thank you so much for being here.
It really means a lot to me.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,040
It's our pleasure.

49
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,219
- Uh, I mean, not our...
- Pardon me.

50
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,687
Uh, I mean, it's, uh,
not a pleasant time,

51
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,683
- and it's not a time...
- No, we're just very sorry.

52
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,764
- We're very sorry.
- We're very sorry.

53
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,480
- I'll get my jacket.
- We just got here.

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,339
What? We've already paid our respects.
I mean, what else are we supposed to do?

55
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,680
Talk to people. It's good for you.

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,728
I don't like talking to people.

57
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Go on.

58
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,762
How are you? How good to see you.

59
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,050
I'm gonna go for a walk.

60
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,567
Okay.

61
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,526
What on earth?

62
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,569
- You want to hike it?
- Yes.

63
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,480
Two thousand miles.

64
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,887
2118, actually.

65
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,528
No. You can't.

66
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,725
Why not?

67
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,521
Seriously, Bill.
Even for you this is ridiculous.

68
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,899
Why? Because you think
I'm too old?

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,843
No, it's not because I think you're too old,
it's because you are too old.

70
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,643
Oh, God, is this because of
the funeral?

71
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,449
- No.
- What then?

72
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,487
Listen, I can't explain it.

73
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,240
Have a go.

74
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,327
It's just something I feel
I have to do.

75
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,209
I want to explore nature.
I want to get back to my roots.

76
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,324
- Roots?
- Yeah. You know, push myself.

77
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,244
I mean, really, really hike.

78
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,526
Hike? You haven't hiked in 30 years.

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,206
- Exactly.
- Can't you just do this in the Volvo?

80
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,521
Catherine.

81
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,290
What if I say you can't go?

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,762
Well, if you felt that way
then we would discuss it.

83
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,779
You mean I'll yammer on
and you'll nod away,

84
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,579
and then you'll go ahead and do whatever
you were going to do anyway

85
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,363
without having heard a word I've said.

86
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,379
What?

87
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,899
Am I just supposed to stand here

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,970
and accept these obvious signs
that you have gone mad?

89
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,240
It's my old pup tent.
What do you think?

90
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,691
Well, I think it's the perfect place
for you to spend the night.

91
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,500
You realize we all think
this is a terrible idea, right?

92
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,100
It's certainly been brought
to my attention.

93
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,281
- But you're still going to do it?
- Yes.

94
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,240
It's just kinda insane, Dad.
The whole thing, at your age?

95
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,180
Fit people in their 20's
can't do it, Dad.

96
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,442
It takes five months
and five millions steps.

97
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,779
- Of walking.
- Yes.

98
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,370
I've been doing it
for a while, you know.

99
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,459
Dad, hiking is not walking.

100
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,529
Two thousand people a year try to do this.
Less than 10% make it.

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,168
You ought to see the statistics
on how many people finish writing a book.

102
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,806
There's somebody
I want you to meet. All right?

103
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,245
Hey, Dave.

104
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,006
How's it going?

105
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,167
This is Dave.

106
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,379
- Dave.
- Hello.

107
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,179
He has hiked everywhere.

108
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,520
He can answer any question
you have about anything.

109
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,124
Okay. Can he tell me
why the caged bird sings?

110
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,764
Can you give us just a second?
And can I?

111
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,645
Can we keep a lid on the jokes,
please?

112
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,162
Pay attention while he's talking,

113
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,860
and don't say,
"You've got to be shitting me"

114
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,100
when he tells you
the price of something.

115
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,043
Sam, you act like
I've never camped before.

116
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,485
A tent is a tent.

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,659
This also has a 70 denier,
high-density, abrasion-resistant fly

118
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,330
with that same rip stop weave.

119
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,404
And just look at these seams.

120
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,528
All lap-felled.
No bias taping on the whole tent.

121
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,804
And the poles.
Color-coded, DAC aluminum.

122
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,442
It's the finest craftsmanship.

123
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,648
Yeah, I've carried this one
on several sections of the trail myself.

124
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,282
For your purposes,
cannot go wrong with this monster.

125
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,820
All right, how much is it?

126
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,365
This one here is 289.

127
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,283
You've got to be shitting... Oh, okay.

128
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,042
I see what you're thinking,
but out on the trail, you're gonna thank me.

129
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,446
Are you coming?

130
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,940
You'll need a rain cover too, of course.

131
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,700
- A rain cover? Why?
- To keep out the rain.

132
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,009
- The backpacks aren't waterproof?
- Not 100%.

133
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,259
The rain cover weighs
four point six ounces.

134
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,682
You know how much weight it would add
to fully waterproof an 85-liter pack?

135
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,642
Well, I'll tell you. It's a lot.

136
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,364
Let's not forget...

137
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,528
Oh, let me guess, in case you want
to do a little impromptu gardening?

138
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,280
No. You know the saying,
"Take only memories, leave only footprints."

139
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,046
Poop.

140
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,682
- Oh, shit.
- Exactly.

141
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,765
Thought you'd find these interesting.

142
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,259
A Virginia man's remains
left undiscovered for 18 days

143
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,139
after he suffers
a catastrophic medical condition

144
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,686
just one week into his solo trek.

145
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,644
Most commonly spread through
infected rodent saliva, urine, and feces,

146
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,443
which become airborne particles...

147
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,580
Several law enforcement personnel
have expressed concern

148
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,331
about the gruesome nature
of these latest murders,

149
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,409
including dismemberment
and ritualistic savagery.

150
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,561
You are not doing this alone.

151
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,926
This is Bryson.

152
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,162
How would you like to join me
for a little stroll?

153
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:27,086
It's a chance to grab some fresh air,
while there's still some left.

154
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,889
You know, studies show
Americans need to walk more.

155
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,249
Our forefathers, they walked everywhere.

156
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,768
It'll give you something to do
for the next six months.

157
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,649
Let me know if you're interested.

158
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,340
Rabies, crazed skunks,
raccoons, and squirrels,

159
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,567
merciless fire ants,
and ravening blackfly.

160
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,659
Poison ivy, poison sumac, poison oak,

161
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,409
poison salamanders,
even a scattering of moose?

162
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,860
Bryson, four words:
Not in this lifetime.

163
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,779
I wish I could, Bill, but I just
switched to a new beta blocker.

164
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,980
I barely have enough energy
to get dressed in the...

165
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,940
Next time, call me for something fun.

166
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,485
Like a colonoscopy.

167
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,980
Bill, I think you've been
the victim of identity theft.

168
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,779
I got the most ridiculous message
from someone claiming...

169
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,962
Bill, you know you can see the whole
trail online in less than four minutes?

170
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,659
You know, you can't count Dan Budge.
Dying is not the same as saying no.

171
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,567
Did we know about that?
About Dan's death?

172
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,445
Yeah, I think
it was in Janice's Christmas card.

173
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,408
Well, that explains why she was so miffed
about my invitation.

174
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,167
It's in the...

175
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,322
Hello?

176
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,807
Hello?

177
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,490
Hey, it's me.

178
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,841
I'm sorry?

179
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,481
Bryson, it's Katz.

180
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,163
- It's Katz?
- Yeah.

181
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,249
- Stephen?
- Yeah.

182
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,044
Whoa.

183
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,530
You're in the States?

184
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,964
Yeah, yeah. Where are you?

185
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,885
I'm in Des Moines.
Where the hell else would I be?

186
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,682
Well, it's good to hear your voice.

187
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,283
Yeah. Hey, Doug told me about
this Appalachian Trail deal of yours.

188
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,850
Are you serious about that?

189
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,168
Yes, I'm very serious.

190
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,721
You think maybe I could come with you?

191
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,291
You wanna come with me?

192
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,820
Yeah, if it's a problem, I understand.

193
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,846
- No, no, no, no.
- I mean, I understand if you don't want me.

194
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,241
No, why... Why wouldn't I want you?

195
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,520
Because, you know,
I still owe you 600 bucks from Europe.

196
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,400
Well, that was forty years ago, Stephen.

197
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,570
Yeah, but I still intend to pay you.

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,565
Well, I know you're good for it.

199
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,169
Ah, great, great.

200
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,408
So, what kind of shape you in?

201
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,240
Well, I'm in good shape.
I walk everywhere these days.

202
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,460
Really?

203
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,139
Yeah, since the bastards
took away my license.

204
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,679
Um...

205
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,964
So, how are you with bears?

206
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,881
Well, they haven't gotten me yet.

207
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,500
Well, you know there can't be a black bear
within 1,500 miles of Des Moines, Katz.

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,844
That's what I'm saying, man.
Those fuckers keep their distance.

209
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,019
You'll never guess
who just gave me a call.

210
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,486
No, no, no. Not Stephen Katz.

211
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,500
Mmm-mmm.

212
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,523
You said I couldn't go alone.

213
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,923
Well, presuming you were going
to get somebody responsible.

214
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,500
You don't even know him.

215
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,966
Well, I know the stories.
Didn't he have a drinking problem?

216
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,100
We all had drinking problems.

217
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,019
Well, you two ended up
on each other's nerves in Europe.

218
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,804
No, no, no, no.
We started out on each other's nerves.

219
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,970
We ended up despising each other.

220
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,562
You know I hate this, right?

221
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,604
Sweetheart, I really don't think
you have anything to worry about.

222
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,220
No. Just my husband wandering off
into the woods,

223
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,527
surely to be maimed or killed

224
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,842
or contract some ghastly
parasitic disease which,

225
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,327
if lucky, will leave him propped up
in a chair, drooling into his own bib.

226
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,100
But there's nothing to worry about,
because of course

227
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,340
I'll be the one expected to stand
by your side, feeding you ice chips

228
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,649
until you capitulate to this unnamed malady,
and then what?

229
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,405
I get to stand in front
of some gaudy church saying,

230
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,886
"He was a loving husband and father,

231
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,059
"once considered to be
a man of reasonable intelligence,

232
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,889
"since revealed to be nothing more

233
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,620
"than a daft and utter fool."

234
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,562
Well, it's a shame
I won't be there to hear it.

235
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,361
Look, I know what this seems like,
okay?

236
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,481
Have you actually
thought this through at all?

237
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,725
Of course not.

238
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,886
Lebanon Airport welcomes
Cape Air Flight 106.

239
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,899
Travelers arriving from Springfield

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,844
can claim their baggage
at Baggage Claim Carousel Four.

241
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,205
You are shitting me.

242
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,923
- Hey, Stephen.
- Bryson.

243
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,730
How are you?

244
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,299
Hello, Steve-o.

245
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,561
This is my wife.

246
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,403
You're the British nurse
I've heard so much about.

247
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,289
- I certainly hope so.
- Yeah.

248
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
Good to meet you.

249
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,243
That's a little bit like a bear hug.

250
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,760
Are you limping?

251
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,928
Oh, that's a titanium knee,
and this one's a trick knee, you know.

252
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,919
- Oh.
- Let me see, I've got to get...

253
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,885
I gotta eat every hour or so,
otherwise I get these, uh...

254
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,807
- What, episodes?
- No, no, they're...

255
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,848
- Seizures?
- Seizures, that's right.

256
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,280
- You get seizures?
- Mmm-hmm.

257
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,048
Yeah. You know, I ate some contaminated
phenethylamines about 10 years ago,

258
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,646
and it totally jacked up my system,
you know.

259
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,851
- I thought you said you were in shape?
- I am.

260
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,483
So the two of them take off
on a motorbike

261
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,641
and we have no choice but to hitchhike
all the way back to San SebastiÃ¡n.

262
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,163
We go into the first pub, and boom,
there they are.

263
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,099
So, six hours later
we stumble out to the beach,

264
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,220
and Bryson insists on having
the pretty girl,

265
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,480
- of course, the redhead.
- Ooh.

266
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,287
And I get the horse-faced blonde,
you know.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Uh, Bryson!

268
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,205
I can't believe...
Come on, sit.

269
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,887
I can't believe
you never told Cathy about Spain.

270
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,326
Oh, it must have slipped my mind.

271
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,324
Hmm, I wonder why?

272
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,204
Anyway, the next day
we're on a train to Madrid.

273
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,140
Bryson goes to the head
and I don't pay any attention to it,

274
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,003
and he's in there a long time.

275
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,579
Finally, I look up,
and he's coming out toward the seat

276
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,489
and he's just scratching
and scratching...

277
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,369
Got it. Got it.

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,579
I said to him,
"Hey, Bryson, what's going on?"

279
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,683
And he says,
"Next time you can have the red-head."

280
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,180
- Is there a picture of the red-head?
- I think so.

281
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,099
I'd like to see the redhead.
I'd love to see the red-head.

282
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,059
- That's a really great story.
- She's not in here.

283
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,339
- Thank you for sharing that with my family.
- Where is she?

284
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,930
Well, I have more of them, Bryson.

285
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,280
No, no, that's great.

286
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,971
- No, no, I think we should have a few more.
- All right.

287
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,940
We were in Nice,
and Bryson goes to this

288
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,044
very famous hotel there
called The Mayflower...

289
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,688
Mmm, the Cubbies.

290
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,567
Oh, decomposed.

291
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,411
Oh, my God.

292
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,125
You still playing that thing?

293
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,528
Oh, yeah. Not good, but I'm playing.

294
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,929
How about you, still playing the drums?

295
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,690
Oh, God, no. I gave that up years ago.

296
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,405
Oh.

297
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,165
Is that your daughter?

298
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,169
- Yeah.
- Takes after her mother. Lucky break there.

299
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,650
- How many grandchildren in all?
- Three, and another one on the way.

300
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,247
You really pulled it off, Bryson.

301
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,641
You know?

302
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,367
No, I mean that. I'm happy for you.

303
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,964
Well, how about you, Stephen?
You... You been okay?

304
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,127
Me? Oh, hell, yeah.

305
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,619
I spent half my life getting drunk,
chasing pussy.

306
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,371
The other half I wasted.

307
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,523
- Have you seen these things?
- Yeah.

308
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,040
Fucked.

309
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,167
Hey, you know, everyone thinks
we're going to go onto that trail

310
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,766
and quit after a week,
like most people do.

311
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,248
We're not most people, Bryson.

312
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,968
No. No, we're not.

313
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,241
- So, good night.
- Good night.

314
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,365
All right then.

315
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,086
- Thank you, Mrs. Bryson. Bye.
- You're welcome. Good luck.

316
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,040
I'll meet you inside. Right?

317
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,922
- I will miss you, you know.
- I hope so.

318
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,765
I just want to go on the record
one last time

319
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,569
and say, I do love you.

320
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,644
Try not to die, okay?

321
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,280
I'll do my best.

322
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,329
Go on. Bugger off.

323
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,210
I remember this one guy that I picked up.
He came off the Trail.

324
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,209
He's not like you guys,
a lot younger.

325
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,682
He got back there
and just started crying.

326
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,606
I'm serious.
Cried all the way back to Atlanta.

327
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,448
Sat back there whimpering
like a child.

328
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,220
When you drop people off,

329
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,606
can you tell whether
they're going to make it or not?

330
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,163
Oh. Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Every time, pretty near.

331
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,559
How about us?

332
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,690
Oh, well, here we are.

333
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,006
Thank you.

334
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,520
- Here you go.
- Okay.

335
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,445
- Breakfast at seven.
- Seven.

336
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,049
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

337
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,642
I hope you don't mind my saying,

338
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,645
but these are about
the best damn pancakes I ever had.

339
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,884
Is that right? Well, I like a man
who appreciates his pancakes.

340
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,248
Well, I sure do appreciate
these, honey.

341
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,088
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah.

342
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,605
And I'll get you a menu.

343
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,570
No, no, I've already eaten.
Thanks.

344
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,246
Not bad looking, huh?

345
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,605
That depends.

346
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,085
You know what I look for
in a female these days?

347
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,122
A heartbeat and a full set of limbs.

348
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,048
Well, most people lower their standards
as they age.

349
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,208
- Yeah?
- You've actually raised yours.

350
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,529
You know, Bryson,
I've been thinking.

351
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,489
Let's stay here another night.

352
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,926
- You kidding?
- No. No. It is cold outside.

353
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,401
It's warm in here.

354
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,566
- I am going.
- Wait a minute.

355
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,567
We go. We go.

356
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,124
Hey, hang on. I'd like to say
a few words if you don't mind.

357
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,800
All right.

358
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,619
- I don't want to reach for metaphors, but...
- No, reach, Bryson, reach.

359
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,847
Well, they say
the Appalachian Trail is like life.

360
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,019
Uh-huh.

361
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,539
You don't know what's ahead, you don't
know what's going to happen next,

362
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,130
but you give it your best shot.

363
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,406
Your best...

364
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,611
So, on that note...

365
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,970
- We go?
- We go.

366
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,520
All right.

367
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,766
You keeping up?

368
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,329
Yeah. Keeping up.

369
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,564
Are we hiking or strolling?

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,444
What, is this a race?

371
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,003
We're trying to do 11 miles.

372
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,059
Slow and steady, pal.
You wanna burn out your legs, go ahead.

373
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,210
- Just be nice to get there before midnight.
- Yeah, well.

374
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,964
That would be nice.

375
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,242
Go ahead. Help yourselves.

376
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,039
Oh, jeez.

377
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,203
Okay, complete the following
sentence.

378
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,884
What goes up must come

379
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,965
down.

380
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,768
What the hell happened to down?
It can't be uphill all the way to Maine.

381
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,530
Coming through.

382
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,660
Oh, my God. All right.

383
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,410
- What's up?
- Not much.

384
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,460
- Beautiful day.
- Yeah, it sure is.

385
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,891
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

386
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,165
Little fuckers.

387
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,326
It's just over the hill, guys.

388
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,660
- Boy.
- You okay?

389
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,603
Yeah. I almost fell off the log.

390
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,088
How far do you figure we've gone?

391
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,243
Oh, about a quarter of a mile.

392
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,163
Motherfuck.

393
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,380
We're going already?

394
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,859
Just kill me now.

395
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,170
I don't care how you do it,
but please, just kill me now.

396
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,320
What, that's it? No dinner?

397
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,161
Hiya.

398
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,884
- You remember the Randall Farm?
- Of course.

399
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,250
Super-Walmart now.

400
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,681
Christ.

401
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,083
The old drive-in theater?

402
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,488
Don't tell me.

403
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,530
- Subaru dealership now.
- No.

404
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,041
Yeah.
I got my first blowjob there.

405
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,044
In the Subaru dealership?

406
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,208
Bit of a late bloomer, huh?

407
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,205
I bumped into Jimmy Duncan
a few weeks back.

408
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,859
You remember him?

409
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,691
Yeah. His mom worked
at the library?

410
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,001
'Course you remember his mom.

411
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,451
Yeah, she was nice.

412
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,044
And she didn't own a bra.

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,324
Well, if she did,
she never wore it.

414
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,684
Man, I loved that library.

415
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,766
- Hey, Bryson?
- Yeah?

416
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,361
Have you really kept in touch
with Doug Glawinski all these years?

417
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,528
No, not at all. Why?

418
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,329
You invited him,
so I was just curious.

419
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,660
Well, yeah. I invited
everyone I could think of.

420
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,761
No, not everyone.

421
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,090
I heard about it from Doug.

422
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,409
I don't think I had your number.

423
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,164
You had Doug's number?

424
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,250
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I really don't like Doug.

425
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,921
Well, I don't blame you.

426
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,963
I'm not sure how that's supposed
to make me feel better, though.

427
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,126
Yeah.

428
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,921
I guess I really didn't think
that through.

429
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,280
Good night.

430
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,721
Good night.

431
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,611
You burying your shit?

432
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,086
Yes.

433
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,560
- In the woods?
- Yeah.

434
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,644
Oh, Bryson, I've missed you.

435
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,366
Thank you.

436
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,527
Can't wait to read about this
in the book.

437
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm not writing a book.

438
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,806
Hi.

439
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,891
You guys camping here?

440
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,726
No, we live here.

441
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,090
What are you guys eating?

442
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,721
Noodles? Ugh, big mistake.

443
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,521
Noodles have got, like, no energy in them.
I mean, like, zero.

444
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,249
I'm Mary Ellen. Is that your tent?

445
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:54,606
Yeah.

446
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,288
Oh, big mistake.

447
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,380
They must have seen you coming
at the camping store.

448
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,925
- How much did you pay for it?
- I don't remember.

449
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,970
Too much. That's how much.

450
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,606
Shoulda got a three-season tent,
my friend.

451
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,565
It is a three-season tent.

452
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,560
Pardon me for saying so,
but it is, like, seriously dumb

453
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,923
to come out here in March
without a three-season tent.

454
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,084
It's April.
And it is a three-season tent.

455
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,923
That's a three-season tent.

456
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,084
No, no. Those are both
three-season tents.

457
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,366
No. I don't think so.

458
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,048
How many miles did you guys do today?

459
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,800
Around 10.

460
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,442
Ten? Oh, you must be
really out of shape.

461
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,049
I did fourteen-two.
Started at Gooch Gap.

462
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,329
Well, so did we.
And it's eight point four.

463
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,125
- No.
- It is. It's eight point four.

464
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,800
Excuse me. But I think I ought to know.
I just walked it.

465
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,130
So did we. And it's eight point four.

466
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,726
Tomato, tomahto.

467
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,289
You know what your problem is?

468
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,365
You're too fat.

469
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,481
Excuse me?

470
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,380
You should have dropped some of that
tonnage before you hit the trailhead.

471
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,961
I mean, you're liable to have some sort
of serious heart thing out here.

472
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,884
And so I just walk alone,
because everybody I know is boring.

473
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,367
I'm the only person I know
who doesn't bore myself to death.

474
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,420
Also, if I walked with someone else,

475
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:32,219
I'd have to watch them make, you know,
mistake after mistake after mistake,

476
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,780
and I'd go crazy, and then I'd not be sane
on the trail, you know?

477
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,565
I was like, "Mary Ellen,
who's the only person you know

478
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,648
"who doesn't mess up?"
and it's like, me.

479
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,659
I went through this person,
it was, like, dumb.

480
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,206
That person, boring. This person, dumb.
Dumb, dumb. Boring, boring.

481
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,601
I know what you're thinking.
I'm not married.

482
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,900
I wonder why?

483
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,005
Well, I do have a boyfriend,
but he's in Florida and he's in prison.

484
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,380
I wouldn't hike with him
even if he wasn't

485
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,722
because you can't trust a convict,
and he's dumb.

486
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,768
And boring, actually.

487
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,568
What's your star sign?
I bet you're a Gemini, aren't you?

488
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,842
Ah, I'm really good at this.
I have a gift.

489
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,360
- No, I'm not a Gemini.
- I think you are.

490
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,530
Actually, I'm a Leo.

491
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,880
I don't think so.
I'm really good at this.

492
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,260
I was born in August.

493
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,202
Mmm, check your birth certificate.

494
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,847
And you? You're a Libra.

495
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,724
Definitely a Libra.
I could make a living doing this.

496
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,891
You're zero for two, honey.
Zero for two.

497
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,565
Can you guys guess what I am?

498
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,728
- Couple of thoughts come to mind.
- Yeah?

499
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,380
She's up all night to the sun

500
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,539
I'm up all night to get some

501
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,619
She's up all night for good fun

502
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,244
We're up all night to get lucky

503
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,081
Fuck.

504
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,847
God damn it. Damn it!

505
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,483
I swear to God
I'm gonna rip her larynx out.

506
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,849
I'm not sure that's going to do it.
I got a better plan.

507
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,219
Go on, lay it on me.

508
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,563
Okay, according to the map,
we get to Hiawassee tomorrow.

509
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,440
We get an early start and we hike hard,
we can put some distance between us.

510
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,730
Yeah, that's probably
better than my plan.

511
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,086
What's your plan?

512
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,123
Kill her. Take her Pop-tarts.

513
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,722
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

514
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,601
You guys heading out?

515
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,289
Yeah. You want us to wait for you?

516
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Yeah, we'll wait.

517
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,440
Nah, I'll catch up. I'm pretty regular.

518
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,885
We go.

519
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,684
We've still got a couple more miles.

520
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,041
How far back is she?

521
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,500
She's gaining.

522
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,250
- I don't think...
- I don't...

523
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,240
We need a new plan.

524
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,648
- Yeah, we do. We need a new plan.
- Yeah.

525
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,539
Shh.

526
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,164
I didn't say anything.

527
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,050
- Well, you sound like a DC-10. Keep it down.
- Oh.

528
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,201
Here she comes.

529
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,530
Hold your breath.

530
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,847
Hold it, hold it.

531
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,889
We've come too far to give up who we are

532
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,481
We go, we go!

533
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,449
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Hey!

534
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,563
Wait, stop!

535
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,525
Who the hell's gonna stop for us?
We look like shit.

536
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,248
Hey, stop!

537
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,760
They stopped!

538
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,204
Hey, you boys want a ride?

539
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,880
Sure do!

540
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,766
Y'all have to excuse us.
We are celebrating.

541
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,043
Yeah? What are you celebrating?

542
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,402
We are getting married tomorrow.

543
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,485
- Great, great.
- Congratulations, you guys.

544
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,900
Yeah, Darren is making
an honest woman out of me.

545
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,364
- Ain't that right, baby?
- Yes, I am.

546
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,525
Uh, you wanna watch the...

547
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Yeah.

548
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,324
Holy shit. I wish I was still 20.

549
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,730
I wish I was still 50.

550
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,809
- See y'all later.
- Bye, y'all.

551
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,420
What can I get you boys to drink?

552
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,922
The tallest and the coldest beer
you can offer.

553
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,081
Coke.

554
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,603
- Just Coke, nothing in it?
- Just Coke. I'm reformed.

555
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,682
- Okay.
- Uh, you know what?

556
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,523
Make mine a Coke also.

557
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,650
All right. Just a second.

558
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,643
Oh, wow. I'm... I'm impressed.

559
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:34,483
Well, you know, ever since
I rolled my car on route six,

560
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,605
- I had to rethink some things.
- Yeah, that'll do it.

561
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:44,521
A lady cop came up to the window
and she knocked.

562
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,603
I was hanging upside down by the seatbelt
and I said, "What's the problem, officer?"

563
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,201
She just stared at me and walked away.

564
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,244
So I haven't had a drink since.

565
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,606
- Really?
- Yeah.

566
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,206
Well, that's good.

567
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,684
- Good for you.
- Yeah. Good for me.

568
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,367
Really.

569
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,646
Ah.

570
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,601
You know, Bryson,

571
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:24,726
I keep looking at the door over there and
I keep seeing Mary Ellen coming through.

572
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,284
I hope you're not going to tell me
you miss her?

573
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,489
Oh, no, no. Hell no,
I'm not going to tell you that.

574
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,340
I mean, we did kind of ditch her though,
didn't we?

575
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,019
No, we didn't just kind of ditch her,
Stephen. We ditched her.

576
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,090
Yeah. We left her all alone in the woods
by herself.

577
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,445
She came into the woods by herself.

578
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,179
It's not like we signed a contract
to look after her.

579
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,010
No, but she's probably scared out
of her wits.

580
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,210
What are you so interested in her for?

581
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm not interested in her at all.

582
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,922
The damndest thing, Bryson,
is I am a Libra.

583
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,965
She got it right.

584
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,722
Maybe she has a gift.

585
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,010
What are the chances?

586
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,369
One in 12, actually.

587
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,128
One in 12. That's pretty damn good.

588
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,641
Oh. Southbound, coming through.

589
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,005
Mary Ellen? Oh, yeah,
she talked about you guys.

590
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,360
Yeah? What did she say?

591
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,451
- Well, her words, right?
- Right.

592
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,802
She said you guys
were a couple of overweight wimps

593
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,445
who didn't know the first thing
about hiking.

594
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,766
And she was tired of carrying you.

595
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,164
Oh, Holy Christ Almighty.

596
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,567
Actually, I think she called you
a couple of pussies.

597
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,204
- Pussies?
- Pussies?

598
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,646
After all we did for her?

599
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,090
You guys know it's supposed
to snow tonight, right? Six to eight inches.

600
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,003
- Really?
- More higher up.

601
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,130
That's what they're saying.
You're going to be climbing right into it.

602
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,481
- Yeah? Oh.
- Yeah.

603
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,248
- Well, I gotta keep moving, guys. Be safe.
- Thanks.

604
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,126
Snow? That guy's out
of his fucking mind.

605
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,407
You okay?

606
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,251
Never better.

607
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,005
Goddamn things are useless.

608
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,451
What I'm thinking we could do
is follow this logging road,

609
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,260
get to the other side of this ridge,
and get out of the wind

610
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,931
where we can set up our camp.
What do you think?

611
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,204
Me? I think I'd rather have
a nice hot soak in a Jacuzzi.

612
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:51,565
But if you're dead-set on following
that logging road, we can do that, too.

613
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:56,204
We can save the Jacuzzi for another time
when things aren't going so well.

614
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,460
Yeah.

615
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,164
- I'll follow you.
- Okay.

616
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,364
Katz, you still there?

617
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,880
Unfortunately.

618
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,364
Just like you said, Bryson.

619
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:35,369
The AT. You never know what lies ahead.

620
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:37,925
So it appears.

621
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,847
I promise you, if there was heat,
it would be on, honey, all right?

622
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,168
Use the talcum powder, that helps.

623
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,409
Hi. We'd like a cabin.
Preferably with a private bath.

624
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,721
The cabins went two days ago.
But I do have two spaces in the bunkhouse.

625
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,327
I don't know if you're
aware of this, Bryson,

626
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,485
but every time I hear
the word "bunkhouse"

627
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:28,210
my testicles shrink up inside my body.

628
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,161
Welcome to the Stalag.

629
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,579
There's a meeting of the Escape
Committee at 1900 hours.

630
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:43,840
Oh, okay.

631
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,130
Hey, are you liking that XT-85?

632
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,405
Your pack.

633
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:02,686
Oh.

634
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,123
- I got a Gregory.
- Oh, yeah?

635
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,766
Yeah. I looked at the XT-85, solid pack.

636
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,041
But the quad access points,

637
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:11,400
dual hydration ports in the Gregory,
they sold me.

638
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,849
What made you buy an XT-85?

639
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,206
I thought it was easier
than carrying everything in my arms.

640
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,327
- How come you're up top?
- Well, heat rises, pal.

641
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:43,050
Oh, yeah.

642
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,050
Hey, you know...

643
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,644
Hey, Bryson, are you all right?

644
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,409
Oh, never better.

645
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:52,804
We can start, maybe, right there and...

646
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,929
Hello, there.

647
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,889
You guys, uh, doing all right?

648
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,965
Yeah, we're fine.

649
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,739
Because, look,
when we get over to the other side,

650
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,967
we can just come back
and grab your packs if you want?

651
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,481
You know, it's easy for us.

652
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:11,925
- Not a problem.
- Happy to help.

653
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:15,925
We like hard, we don't like easy.
But thanks a lot, you know.

654
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,402
- All right, then.
- Okay.

655
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:22,009
- Excuse us. All right.
- Yep.

656
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:35,324
- Nice guys.
- Yep.

657
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,762
- I hate 'em.
- Me, too.

658
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,440
Well...

659
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,690
- That went well.
- It was refreshing.

660
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,367
Bryson, you've got everything
a man could want.

661
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,521
And here you are,
tramping around in the woods with me.

662
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,885
Seriously, what gives?

663
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:39,844
I don't know.

664
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,610
As John Muir once said,
"Sometimes a man just has to

665
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:49,360
"get a loaf of bread and throw it into
a sack, and jump over the back fence."

666
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:51,563
Oh, I got you.

667
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,411
Life's a little too perfect
inside that fence, huh?

668
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,280
- No, no, no...
- Oh, you made sense, Bryson.

669
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,969
You're a caged animal.

670
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:02,322
You wanna get back into that forest.
Live a little.

671
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,331
- That's not it.
- No, that's got to be it.

672
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,844
So why'd you come?

673
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:13,086
I guess I didn't want to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

674
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,887
- What?
- It's nothing, really.

675
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,208
Just a couple of outstanding warrants
I didn't show up for and stuff like that.

676
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,927
Jesus, Stephen, that's really
not something you can run from.

677
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,847
Actually, you kind of can.

678
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,887
Same old Stephen.
Always running from something.

679
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,686
Oh, really? You're one to talk.

680
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,485
Not you.

681
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,882
Remind me again why we're out here?

682
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,340
It's was not like you had
something better to do.

683
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,965
As I recall, in fact,
you begged me to come.

684
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,963
I begged? I begged to come? I asked.

685
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,047
You know what cracks me up, Bryson?

686
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:56,460
Is how predictable your whole life
has become, right down to the Volvo.

687
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,402
God forbid somebody should evolve

688
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:00,284
rather than squandering away
their existence.

689
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,768
I mean, look at you. All these years
and you're still stuck at square one.

690
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,219
Hey, Bryson. Are you happy?

691
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,003
What the hell kind
of a question is that?

692
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,322
Pretty important question, I'd say.

693
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,646
What, do you think you're happy?

694
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,365
I think...

695
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,371
Wow.

696
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,329
The Smokies.

697
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:36,443
Now this is interesting.

698
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,739
Oh, God, this is amazing.

699
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,206
From here you can see
all three kinds of rock.

700
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,161
There, you see that layered section
across that slant?

701
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,804
- Yeah.
- That's sedimentary.

702
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,420
And the dark stuff here, pushing up
from underneath, that's igneous.

703
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:55,681
Think volcanic.

704
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,202
How do you know all this stuff?

705
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,043
Well, there are these things
called books.

706
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,280
- Oh. No kidding, they're called books?
- Yeah, they're like TV for smart people.

707
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:07,726
See, what we're talking about here,
Katz, is time.

708
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:09,646
Geologic time.

709
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:14,601
Hundreds of thousands of years
of enormous, shifting tectonic plates.

710
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,923
It's like the world being reborn from below
while it's being eroded from above.

711
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,971
Yeah. Well,

712
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,686
when we get back I'm gonna buy you a TV.

713
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,050
Because nobody gives a fuck
about shifting tectonic plates.

714
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:30,240
Well, I do.

715
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,039
You know why?

716
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,085
Because I'm curious,
and I love being curious.

717
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,927
I like knowing things about the world
that we're living in.

718
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,641
Well, I think it's all fucking rock.

719
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:42,371
Oh, yeah?

720
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,686
I don't get bogged down in the minutiae.

721
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,440
- I'm above the details.
- You are?

722
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:49,927
I'm big picture, Bryson.

723
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,699
Oh. How's that working out for you?

724
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,246
Ah, pretty, uh, fucking good.

725
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,965
Hello.

726
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,646
We'd like a room, please.

727
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,409
Two rooms.

728
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,443
Oh, the Cubbies lost a double header,
and they're 11 games back.

729
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,005
Don't act surprised.

730
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,164
Tonight would be preferable.

731
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,650
Hello there?

732
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,420
Where are the Red Sox?

733
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:49,965
Red Sox?
Are you fucking kidding me? Whoa.

734
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:51,340
Excuse me, ma'am.

735
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,420
- Red Sox?
- I live in New England.

736
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,161
Yeah, but Bryson, it's not about
where you live, it's about who you are.

737
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,289
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm the kind of guy
that likes it when a team wins now and then.

738
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,851
Well, you don't...

739
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:06,081
You don't give up on a team just because
they've had a few bad years.

740
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,322
A few bad years? Jesus.

741
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,648
Baseball is about loyalty.

742
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,123
Like, she knows what I'm talking about.
Don't you?

743
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:19,085
Would you two like a minute?

744
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,001
Hi, I'm Jeannie. How can I help y'all?

745
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,443
Mother, let go of the man's hand.

746
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,485
- Hi.
- Hi.

747
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,206
Um, we'd like a couple of rooms. Please.

748
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,608
Oh, sure. Where are you all from?

749
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:36,561
Uh, I live in New Hampshire,
but I spent over 10 years in England.

750
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:39,126
- Mostly in the north countryside...
- He's from Iowa.

751
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:44,043
Well, the rooms are 40 a night
and you can pay when you leave.

752
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,204
Mother, I said,
"Let go of the man's hand."

753
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:53,005
Thank you.

754
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,047
Helluva grip.

755
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,780
The Cubs should sign her.
She'd be the youngest in their bullpen.

756
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,244
- I guess this is me.
- Yeah, okay. I'm right here.

757
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,251
- Yeah.
- Yeah. All right. I'll see you.

758
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:08,365
Yeah.

759
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,445
Ah!

760
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,603
- Hi.
- Hello, again.

761
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:15,960
- How can I help you?
- I just need some towels.

762
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,288
- Oh. I'm sorry about that.
- That's fine.

763
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,925
- Here, come with me.
- Okay.

764
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,050
Yeah, it's family owned and operated.
For three generations, if you can believe it.

765
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:35,686
Oh, I can.

766
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,728
It has a personal feel to it.
That's pretty rare these days.

767
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:42,045
Eighty-three years.

768
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,161
Wow.

769
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,483
We, um... We added the restaurant
10 years ago.

770
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,802
- So you manage that, too?
- Yeah.

771
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,170
Somebody's gotta do it.

772
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,887
It's not so bad.
I get to meet interesting people.

773
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,010
I'm not sure I qualify as interesting.

774
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,690
Oh, I wasn't talking about you.

775
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,648
Sorry. Could not resist.

776
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:21,164
- I'm glad I'm here to amuse you.
- Yeah, yeah. Me, too.

777
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:24,365
This is you.

778
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,331
You must be exhausted.

779
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,570
Holy shit.

780
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,371
I... I gave you a couple extras.

781
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:39,280
Enjoy your shower.

782
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,166
I will, thanks.

783
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,610
Do you need anything else?

784
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,965
No. Not at the moment.

785
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,525
Okay.

786
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:52,289
Well, you know where I am. All right.

787
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,659
We're not here right now,

788
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,889
but please leave a message
and thank you for calling. Bye.

789
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,331
Hi, sweetie. It's me.
Uh, just calling to say I love you.

790
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:21,641
Right, right. That's the one.

791
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,485
Nice, isn't it? I like it.

792
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,659
Everything good on the home front?

793
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,603
She's impressed
we haven't killed ourselves yet.

794
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,603
She's not the only one.

795
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,248
Did you tell her about last night?

796
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,965
What?

797
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,451
You in a robe?

798
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,483
The proprietress,
I'm sure, was looking to hand over

799
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,443
more than just towels.

800
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,967
You're out of your mind.

801
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,487
Am I?

802
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:54,804
Sure will make a steamy chapter
in the book.

803
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,525
Katz, I told you I'm not writing a book.

804
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,568
Listen, I'm going
to go over to, uh, K-Mart.

805
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,646
Get a couple of things. You okay?

806
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,240
Oh, I'm in my happy place.

807
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,126
Good.

808
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,047
Idiot!

809
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:48,170
Oh, wait, wait.

810
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,880
Here, here.

811
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,284
- Here you are, ma'am. Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

812
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,409
- Pardon me.
- Hmm?

813
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,525
I'm so sorry. Do you think
you could give me a hand here?

814
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,248
Well, certainly. I'd be happy to.

815
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,722
What seems to be the problem?

816
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,764
I'm having a difficult time
removing my panties.

817
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,380
Well, luckily you're

818
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,481
- in the presence of an expert.
- Oh.

819
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,244
May I?

820
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,088
- Oh, they're silk, aren't they?
- Mmm-hmm.

821
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:15,047
I'm a pantyologist.

822
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,121
Really? I've never heard of that.

823
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,965
- Oh.
- Oh.

824
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:28,760
Well,

825
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,447
these aren't gonna do you much good.

826
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,762
Well, they might not do me
much bad, either.

827
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:41,085
No.

828
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,768
- Jesus, Bryson.
- Don't ask.

829
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:55,809
You been screwing hogs again?

830
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,286
You're just jealous.

831
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,284
Actually, I'm not.

832
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:04,248
In your absence, my romantic life
has taken a turn for the better.

833
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:06,485
Remember the laundromat?

834
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,128
Her name is Beulah.

835
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:10,721
Seriously?

836
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,088
Yeah, seriously.
And she's got a beautiful body.

837
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,766
Buried under two hundred pounds of fat.

838
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,380
But then, you know I kinda like
a little meat on the bone.

839
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,280
Sure, as long as you don't have to remove
a wall to get her out of the house.

840
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,039
How did this happen?

841
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,362
She asked me if I would come
take a look at her panties.

842
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:35,686
- What?
- They were caught in the agitator.

843
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:37,286
And they were shredded.

844
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,240
So I'm gonna meet her this afternoon
in front of the fire station.

845
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:43,364
Is that where she keeps
her spare underwear?

846
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,847
I'm telling you, man,
I felt a stiffening of the old resolve.

847
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,320
- Oh, yeah?
- I got her these.

848
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,005
Oh, she's a big woman.

849
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,360
Where'd you get these?

850
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,364
K-Mart. I took a cab.

851
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,731
Um, I thought I'd give 'em
to her at dinner.

852
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,326
As an ice-breaker.

853
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,619
You're gonna give those to her
in a restaurant?

854
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:11,780
Yeah.

855
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,882
Unless you think it's a bad idea.

856
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:17,563
No. I think that's a great idea.

857
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,485
Good.

858
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:29,280
Hey.

859
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,809
- You had the turkey, right?
- Yes.

860
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,244
- Enjoy.
- All right.

861
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,860
We go. We go.

862
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,485
- What are you talking about?
- There's some guy looking for me!

863
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,699
Some guy?

864
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,925
Beulah's husband.

865
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:57,809
- Beulah's got a husband?
- Yeah.

866
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,601
I mean, there's only two guys on the planet
that would go to bed with her,

867
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,139
and here we are in the same damned town!

868
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:05,605
So what happened?

869
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:09,340
I'm standing in front of the fire station
like we planned.

870
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,500
Yeah.

871
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:14,923
And then around the corner comes
this red pickup and it screeches to a halt.

872
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,250
And this big guy,
he's angry, he gets out,

873
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:21,489
and he's walking up towards me,
and he's going like this.

874
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:22,806
"I want to talk to you."

875
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,364
- So what did you do?
- I ran.

876
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,019
You ran?

877
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,780
Yeah. I can move like a jack-rabbit
if I have to.

878
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,726
- So he didn't catch you?
- No, no. He's 600 pounds.

879
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,019
He's not exactly a track star.

880
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:39,659
He's cruising around now in his red
pickup truck looking for me.

881
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,163
I been running through back yards,
clothes lines, all sorts of shit.

882
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,201
- Well, you're safe now.
- This guy is...

883
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,126
Red pickup!

884
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,331
And there's another one!

885
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,340
Come on, Bryson, we need a plan!

886
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,329
Why don't you go out and talk to the guy,
huh? I'm sure he's reasonable.

887
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:02,320
That's your plan?

888
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,570
I don't need a plan.
I'm not being chased.

889
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,780
Now, come on, Bryson,
we gotta get outta here.

890
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,326
- Yeah.
- Come on, don't mess around with me.

891
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,005
Please?

892
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,411
- Come on!
- Yeah, yeah.

893
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:27,971
Hey buddy, you in there?

894
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,161
It's Bubba T. Flubba! Are you in there, boy?
Come out, you chicken shit!

895
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,481
Come on! Don't mess around!

896
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:53,019
Open up!

897
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,440
I know you're in there,
you son of a bitch!

898
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:56,766
Holy shit.

899
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,206
He's here!

900
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,860
I don't care where the hell you are,

901
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,882
I'll knock every one
of these damned doors down!

902
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:05,210
Come on, I know you're in here
somewhere, you son of a bitch!

903
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,728
I don't care where you are,
I'm gonna find you!

904
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,163
I want to know who's been messing
with my Beulah!

905
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,681
- Bring your ass out here!
- Come on, Bryson!

906
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,882
Pull me through! He's at the door!

907
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:23,125
Open the goddamned door!

908
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,690
Come on, move it! Move it!

909
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,409
But what about Basel?
When we stole the boat?

910
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,019
We didn't steal the boat,
we borrowed the boat.

911
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:50,001
Yes, well, the girl's uncle
with the shotgun, he saw it differently.

912
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:51,760
He sure did.

913
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:33,527
You know, you missed out in Greece.

914
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:36,210
I'd kind of had my fill by that point.

915
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:39,967
When you said you were gonna go
to England, I thought you'd last,

916
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,724
one week. Tops.

917
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,099
- Well, I met a gal.
- Yeah.

918
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:45,201
And that was that.

919
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:48,130
Well... Yeah, thank you.

920
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:55,121
Cathy seems great. But obviously
you've been with other women.

921
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,405
Never?

922
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,684
In the last 40 years?

923
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,047
Nope.

924
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:12,561
Bullshit, you son of a bitch.

925
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,481
I saw you undress that proprietress
six ways to Sunday.

926
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,371
- You can't tell me you didn't.
- Well...

927
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,328
One woman all these years?

928
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:25,487
Yep.

929
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,408
That can't be good for you.

930
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,363
I mean, when was the last time
that you even got a, uh...

931
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,805
Well, never mind.
I know how married women are.

932
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,880
Really? Is that so?

933
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:47,443
Yeah. Trust me. I've been with way more
married women than you have.

934
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,283
Hey, Katz, you awake?

935
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,208
No.

936
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,400
What was that?

937
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,208
How the hell should I know?

938
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,765
It sounded big.

939
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,088
Everything sounds big
in the woods, Bryson.

940
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,331
It's probably just a skunk. Go to bed.

941
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,280
Did you pack a knife?

942
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,640
No.

943
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,921
Nothing sharp?

944
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,739
Nail clippers.

945
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,251
Swell.

946
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,923
Just leave it alone, Bryson.
It will go away.

947
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,220
Oh, yeah, well if it is a bear
and it comes toward you,

948
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:58,208
what are you going to do?
Give it a pedicure?

949
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,243
Jesus! Two fucking bears
staring right at me.

950
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,364
Oh, god dammit, Bryson, get some sleep.

951
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:09,440
Holy shit.

952
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:14,125
If they come for us, play dead.

953
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:16,805
If they come for us, we are dead.

954
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:18,650
No, wait, wait, wait.

955
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:21,530
That's grizzlies. Wait a minute.

956
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,405
Motherfuck.
They're tearing everything apart.

957
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:28,283
Okay. "Stand up as tall as you can
to intimidate the bear."

958
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,042
Intimidate the bear?
They're fucking bears!

959
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:36,810
We've got to scare them off.

960
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,291
Get! Scat!

961
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,363
You gotta put this in the book.

962
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,211
- There's not going to be a goddamned book.
- Oh.

963
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,365
Jeez. Damn.

964
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,243
Come on, we're having fun.

965
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:02,685
Holy shit.

966
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,729
- Look at this.
- What?

967
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:07,769
This is the trail.

968
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,699
Here we are.
We're not even halfway there.

969
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,927
- This can't be right.
- Son of a bitch.

970
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,604
No way that's to scale.

971
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:18,605
It says, "Map to Scale".

972
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,887
That's it. New plan.

973
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:24,685
God damn it.

974
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:33,203
I'm telling you, Bryson,
there's a lot of advantages.

975
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,699
You want to drive the Appalachian Trail?

976
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,725
No, no, just jump ahead.
Pick up the trail a little further north.

977
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:46,126
You know, we can rent a car over here.

978
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:48,408
Then we're mobile, we'll see more.

979
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:51,601
Check out local points of interest.

980
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,722
Bigger field of vision.

981
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:02,649
Bryson, as a friend,

982
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,887
do this for me.

983
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:32,442
Hey, you're not gonna believe the deal
I got on this.

984
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,779
Katz...

985
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,122
This beauty represents not one,
but two upgrades.

986
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:43,286
Satellite radio, leather seats, sunroof.
Same price as a Camry.

987
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,659
If you can believe that.

988
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,340
Here you go, Mr. Katz. Just three quick
initials and you'll be on your way.

989
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:48,725
We can't do this.

990
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:51,010
Of course we can.

991
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:52,689
I came out here to accomplish something.

992
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,841
Not to just give up
when things got a little tough.

993
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,962
We're not giving up, Bryson.

994
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,850
What does it matter
if we skip the shitty parts?

995
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,443
- No one's gonna know.
- Well, I will.

996
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,849
I'm not a quitter.
I know it served you well in your life,

997
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:09,327
- but I finish what I start.
- Bryson.

998
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:13,363
- Did we not both see the same map?
- Yeah.

999
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,207
You have no chance
of finishing this trail.

1000
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,100
None. Zero. Zilch.

1001
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:21,689
Well, I'm sure as hell gonna try.

1002
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,368
Hike until you die.

1003
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,046
Where do I sign up?

1004
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:31,170
We're two old men, Bryson.
You gotta quit thinking otherwise.

1005
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:32,400
Speak for yourself.

1006
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:37,211
Just because you don't accept something,
Bryson, doesn't mean it's not true.

1007
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,300
- Well, that's interesting, coming from you.
- Just three initials is all...

1008
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:41,819
It's everything with you, Bryson.

1009
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,560
Christ, if someone asks you
where you're from, you can't even answer.

1010
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,927
Oh, so I'm the one in denial, huh?

1011
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:51,650
When you're the one
hiding whiskey in your pack.

1012
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,921
- Oh.
- I saw the bottle.

1013
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:56,404
So I guess neither of us
can accept who we really are.

1014
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,530
Oh, I know who I am and why I'm here.

1015
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,220
I came out here to be with you,

1016
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:05,243
to sneak in one last adventure
before it's too late.

1017
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,761
Well, this is my adventure,
and you signed on.

1018
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,449
You can do whatever you want,
but you're not going to drag me down.

1019
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,287
- If you could just use that pen to sign...
- Fine!

1020
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:16,402
- I don't want your car.
- Excuse me?

1021
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,079
I don't want your goddamn car.

1022
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,371
Fine!

1023
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,251
- Well, that's the spirit.
- Yeah. Fuck.

1024
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,411
I sure am glad
we aren't driving right now.

1025
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:38,087
- You?
- I couldn't be happier.

1026
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,250
You know, 50 years ago,

1027
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,802
one in every four of these trees
was an American Chestnut.

1028
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:50,970
- You know what that is? You ever seen one?
- I think so.

1029
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,086
It's incredible.

1030
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:56,721
They rise from the forest floor,
clear to the top. 100 feet.

1031
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:00,283
And their branches contain
an acre of leaves. An acre.

1032
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:02,845
You look into these woods

1033
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:05,440
and you think they've always been there
and always will be,

1034
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,404
like this old oak tree here.

1035
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,849
And then you think about
the poor unsuspecting American Chestnut,

1036
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:15,726
and think just in a lifetime...
Poof. Gone. Just like that.

1037
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,161
What happened to it?

1038
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,081
A fungus.

1039
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,320
You know. Just, you know, time. Nature.

1040
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,921
You know, Bryson,
I wasn't actually hiding this.

1041
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,921
I wasn't lying about being dry either.

1042
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,211
The thing is, Bryson, I love to drink.
Everything about it.

1043
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:18,088
I love the taste.

1044
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,850
And that buzz you get
after you've had a couple.

1045
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:25,921
I love the smell of the tavern,
right down to the urinal cakes.

1046
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:27,445
Hmm.

1047
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,127
But instead of going into the taverns
like everybody else,

1048
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,725
I go home to my little apartment,
and heat my TV dinner,

1049
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:39,090
and feel all virtuous
like I'm supposed to.

1050
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,122
But you know, night after night
it's hard to persuade yourself

1051
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:48,961
that you're living a rich
and thrilling existence.

1052
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,131
I mean, if they had a fun-o-meter

1053
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,923
the needle wouldn't exactly be jumping
into the orgasmic zone.

1054
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,250
You know what I'm saying?

1055
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:09,847
I mean, there's just this hole in my life
where drinking used to be.

1056
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,523
I know I can't drink.

1057
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,087
I mean, one drink will lead to 10.

1058
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:24,359
And the next thing, I'll find myself
underneath a bridge somewhere.

1059
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:35,170
That's why I carry this.

1060
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:38,051
To remind myself that I can.

1061
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,360
Or maybe I carry it in case I can't.

1062
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,720
Here.

1063
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:50,360
Open it.

1064
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,805
It's sealed.

1065
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:05,680
Give it to me.

1066
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,005
It's shaking.

1067
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:25,140
Do you think I have it in me

1068
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:28,403
to never have another drink
for the rest of my life?

1069
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:33,565
Yeah. I do.

1070
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,524
That was a nice moment.

1071
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:53,283
Real dramatic.

1072
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,286
Christ if I don't already regret it.

1073
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:01,890
Ain't that life.

1074
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,564
Watch it.

1075
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:29,327
You know, Bryson, I still dream
about Amorina. You remember her?

1076
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,962
Oh, God, can't forget a girl like that.

1077
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:37,403
You know guys like us aren't supposed
to meet women named Amorina.

1078
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:39,805
Disturbs the natural order.

1079
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:45,329
Still the best boobs I've ever seen,
and I've seen a lot of boobs, Bryson.

1080
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:46,565
Yeah, I'll bet.

1081
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,005
Hey, you remember her sister?

1082
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:53,643
Oh, God, that poor girl.
They couldn't have been sisters.

1083
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,207
If you're going to be ugly,
you better be funny.

1084
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:58,527
And if you're ugly and you're not funny,
you better have money.

1085
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,525
And if you're zero for three,
you better be slutty.

1086
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,369
- She was.
- Wait a minute, how did you know that, huh?

1087
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,720
Well, actually...

1088
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:29,529
Jesus Christ.

1089
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:34,841
Next time you do that,
let me know, okay?

1090
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:38,050
It's more fun if it's a surprise.

1091
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,939
- You all right?
- You okay?

1092
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:44,166
Yeah.

1093
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:53,485
Jesus.

1094
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,206
Oh...

1095
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,166
We are fucked.

1096
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,409
Monumentally.

1097
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,489
There's no way out over here.

1098
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:35,560
Uh...

1099
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,127
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna get us out of here.

1100
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:43,208
- Give me your pants.
- Uh, no, no.

1101
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,779
You've been planning this
the whole time, Bryson.

1102
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,847
Just give me your pants, okay?

1103
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:50,600
Okay.

1104
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,530
Okay. Knot this thing.

1105
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:13,810
- All right?
- Okay.

1106
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,886
Here we go.

1107
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,569
It is embarrassing, Bryson.
Give me that thing.

1108
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:43,806
You gotta admit,
pretty good aim, though, huh?

1109
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,810
Yeah. But you're supposed to hold on
to one end of it.

1110
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:52,444
Well, you know, it's not that high.

1111
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:56,050
Here, I got it. You see this?
You could come up here.

1112
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,561
I'll be around like this
and you could climb up on my shoulders.

1113
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:03,010
- Wanna try it?
- Okay.

1114
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:07,167
Okay. Hang on.

1115
01:25:13,039 --> 01:25:14,020
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1116
01:25:14,119 --> 01:25:15,724
We can make it. Hold...

1117
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:19,408
- You all right? What?
- Yeah, hang on. You know...

1118
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,520
This isn't... You've got to get lower,
so I can get on your shoulders.

1119
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,211
Fuck. Fine.

1120
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,881
Okay.

1121
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,161
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1122
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,922
Okay. There we go.

1123
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,560
Bryson, I really don't like this.

1124
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,762
No, no, it's good, it's good.
Now, you stand up. Stand up.

1125
01:25:57,279 --> 01:25:58,520
Jesus!

1126
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,720
Who are we kidding?

1127
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,560
For Christ's sake, I can't even
get myself up from that position.

1128
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,042
- All right, then. I'll stand on your back.
- How about I stand on your back?

1129
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:15,365
You know,

1130
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,970
I think we're really stuck here.

1131
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,082
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

1132
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,882
You know, on the East coast
hardwoods are dying.

1133
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,122
Not just the chestnut,

1134
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,881
but the elm's on its way, too, you know.

1135
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,365
Fifty years, this could all be gone.

1136
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,764
Thirty days.

1137
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,060
Hmm?

1138
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:50,289
Thirty days in jail.
I was afraid of 30 days.

1139
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,445
Compared to this,

1140
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,042
I mean, it's like a goddamned trip
to the spa.

1141
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,020
God, all I've done is write forewords
for books

1142
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:07,530
for the last four and a half years.

1143
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:10,300
I should have just retired.

1144
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:13,164
Catherine was right,
what the hell am I trying to prove?

1145
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:18,648
Women love a felony record.

1146
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:24,171
Maybe not up in New Hampshire,
where you are.

1147
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:29,046
But in Des Moines,
it would have served me well.

1148
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,324
Do you just get to the point where

1149
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:36,006
it's all about ailments,
and medications, and funerals,

1150
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,126
and who's being diagnosed with what,

1151
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:42,845
and everyone's just waiting around
for the end.

1152
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,939
- Holy shit.
- What?

1153
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:49,886
I just realized,
we're the guy in the article.

1154
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:55,369
You know, the, uh, decomposed guy.
Remember that?

1155
01:27:56,039 --> 01:27:57,404
That'll be us.

1156
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:00,770
How long does it take a body
to decompose?

1157
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,404
Well, you don't have to worry.

1158
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,060
You're so chock-full of preservatives,
you'll be on this ledge forever.

1159
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:13,921
Well, scientists will come from
all over the world to study me, you know.

1160
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:16,890
I miss Catherine.

1161
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:19,168
I miss Des Moines.

1162
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:23,884
You know, I haven't missed a State Fair
in 39 years.

1163
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,247
I always say, "When I miss one,

1164
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:32,500
"I'll be dead."

1165
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,659
You know, she makes this little sound
whenever I hug her.

1166
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,524
I don't even think she knows it.

1167
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:42,443
I've never told her
how much I love that.

1168
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:50,404
I just don't want her to think this trip
had anything to do with her.

1169
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,244
She knows.

1170
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,360
Believe me, women have a way
of knowing these things.

1171
01:28:59,239 --> 01:29:01,128
Yeah, but still, I'd like to tell her.

1172
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,569
Well, write her a note.

1173
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,809
People love to get notes.

1174
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,488
- Hey, you know, you're right.
- Yeah.

1175
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,371
Hey, that's a great idea.

1176
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:31,291
You know, Bryson, you're the only guy
I'd risk my life with.

1177
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:34,609
I want you to know that.

1178
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,324
And the only asshole who can get me out
on a ledge in the middle of nowhere.

1179
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,644
I'm sorry we lost touch.

1180
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,328
I know. Yeah, me too.

1181
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:06,011
Goddamned gorgeous night.

1182
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,005
It sure is.

1183
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,319
You think there's anyone else on Earth

1184
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,845
looking up at the sky and seeing
as many stars as we are?

1185
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:21,359
I don't know.

1186
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,280
I gotta be looking at a million.

1187
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,801
The naked eye can see 2,000.

1188
01:30:34,119 --> 01:30:38,250
Well, then I really got great eyes
'cause I'm looking at a million.

1189
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:43,728
Alpha Centauri's the closest.
That's four and a half light years away.

1190
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,082
Four and a half? That's not bad.

1191
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:50,484
Each light year is six trillion miles,
so that's...

1192
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,207
twenty six trillion miles.

1193
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:58,681
- Twenty-six trillion. That's the closest?
- Yep.

1194
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,319
And there's one hundred billion stars
in our galaxy.

1195
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:08,087
There's more galaxies in the universe
than there are grains of sand on earth.

1196
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,444
That is big.

1197
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,201
- And we are small.
- Yeah.

1198
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:45,405
What the...

1199
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:48,365
People?

1200
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:51,920
People? People?

1201
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:54,604
- People?
- People?

1202
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,800
People! Hello!

1203
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:01,930
- Hello! Hello, down here!
- Hello!

1204
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:03,965
Help, please!

1205
01:32:05,079 --> 01:32:06,127
Help!

1206
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,926
Hey, down there.

1207
01:32:14,119 --> 01:32:15,201
You've got to be shitting me.

1208
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,445
What happened to your pants?

1209
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,291
- Uh, it's a long story.
- Copy that.

1210
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,082
You guys just stay put.
We'll get you out of there.

1211
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:28,689
- Nice fellas.
- Yeah.

1212
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:32,327
- I love those guys.
- Me, too.

1213
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,011
- You still got some of that jerky?
- Yeah.

1214
01:32:47,239 --> 01:32:48,699
You still good on water?

1215
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,962
- About three-quarters. You?
- Yeah, same.

1216
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,051
- Hey, Stephen?
- Yeah?

1217
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:04,404
Do you want to go home?

1218
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:12,801
Yeah, I do. I really do.

1219
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,484
We weren't even close, were we?

1220
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,009
What are you talking about?
We did it, Bryson.

1221
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,405
We never even laid eyes
on Mount Katahdin.

1222
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:35,899
Another mountain?
How many mountains do you need to see?

1223
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:41,402
- That's one way of looking at it.
- That's the only way of looking at it.

1224
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:45,561
As far as I'm concerned,
we walked the Appalachian Trail.

1225
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,939
We walked it in the heat,
we walked it in the snow,

1226
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,122
we walked it until our feet bled.

1227
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:54,368
We hiked the Appalachian Trail, Bryson.

1228
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,250
Maybe you're right.

1229
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,681
- You guys called a cab? All right.
- Yeah.

1230
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:20,163
This thing's heavy.
You been carrying it awhile?

1231
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:21,970
All the way from Georgia.

1232
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:25,403
You don't say. Good for you, fellas.
Hey, where you guys from?

1233
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,966
Iowa.

1234
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:29,405
That's not possible.

1235
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,921
No such thing as a Red Sox
fan from Iowa.

1236
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,085
Here you go.

1237
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,405
"Dearest Catherine..."
That's as far as you got?

1238
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,444
It's lucky we were saved.

1239
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,761
There are certain things
you just can't put into words.

1240
01:34:58,119 --> 01:34:59,609
Safe journey, okay?

1241
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,121
Yeah.

1242
01:35:13,239 --> 01:35:15,207
You still owe me 600 bucks.

1243
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,729
You know I'm good for it, right?

1244
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:19,487
Oh, yeah.

1245
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,045
Remember me?

1246
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:57,162
Oh.

1247
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,211
She had one hell of a stack
of pancakes. Katz.

1248
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,845
I hate your guts.

1249
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,729
Never buy underpants
for a woman you don't know.

1250
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,403
Fuckers still didn't get me.

1251
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,569
Bryson, just wondering,
what's next?

      "[3]: The clipper to America.\n",
      "[4]: A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. What sort is he?\n",
      "[5]: Here they are.\n",
      "[6]: I bet they're asleep in New York.\n",
      "[7]: Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I...?\n",
      "[8]: Underground, like everywhere else.\n",
      "[9]: She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me.\n",
      "[10]: Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening.\n",
      "[11]: If you will come--\n",
      "[12]: Louis, I'll make a deal with you.\n",
      "[13]: A couple of thousand less than I thought there would be.\n",
      "[14]: Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.\n",
      "[15]: My dear, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap.\n",
      "[16]: Since no one is to blame...\n",
      "[17]: In many ways I am so much older than he is.\n",
      "[18]: Sorry, monsieur, we were never to handle the police.\n",
      "[19]: You won't dare to interfere with me here.\n",
      "[20]: Perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.\n",
      "[21]: I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.\n",
      "[22]: I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy...\n",
      "[23]: ...and worshiped him...\n",
      "[24]: I'll die in Casablanca.\n",
      "[25]: Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.\n",
      "[26]: I see what you mean.\n",
      "[27]: Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue. Thank--\n",
      "[28]: You're a coward and a weakling.\n",
      "[29]: You love her that much?\n",
      "[30]: If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it.\n",
      "[31]: ...I certainly won't give them to you now.\n",
      "[32]: Perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.\n",
      "[33]: Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?\n",
      "[34]: You see, major? You have nothing to worry about Rick.\n",
      "[35]: It'll be interesting to see how he manages.\n",
      "[36]: - You're saying this only to make me go. - I'm saying it because it's true.\n",
      "[37]: But that was all over long ago.\n",
      "[38]: I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over it's a little short.\n",
      "[39]: Then we shall state another time and place. Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.\n",
      "[40]: - Get me the radio tower. - Put it down!\n",
      "[41]: Instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big...\n",
      "[42]: It's a game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.\n",
      "[43]: Good. I've got the letters here, made out in blank.\n",
      "[44]: - What was the meaning of that phone call? - Victor Laszlo is on that plane.\n",
      "[45]: Cannot be rescinded. Not even questioned.\n",
      "[46]: - I don't think I can remember-- - If she can stand it, I can.\n",
      "[47]: For all of us.\n",
      "[48]: If you knew how much I loved you.\n",
      "[49]: Doesn't matter.\n",
      "[50]: We Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara.\n",
      "[51]: I'm awfully sorry.\n",
      "[52]: - What makes you think we want to hold you? - Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.\n",
      "[53]: Night.\n",
      "[54]: I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.\n",
      "[55]: Yes, Victor, I was.\n",
      "[56]: We might as well question why we breathe.\n",
      "[57]: Important.\n",
      "[58]: And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or Oran...\n",
      "[59]: That is also true, except for one destination: occupied France.\n",
      "[60]: I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.\n",
      "[61]: - For how long? - Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.\n",
      "[62]: Laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record.\n",
      "[63]: And I'm leaving, finally, this Casablanca.\n",
      "[64]: Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.\n",
      "[65]: We loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you--\n",
      "[66]: Major.\n",
      "[67]: Certainly, Rick, anything you say.\n",
      "[68]: Thank you, Carl.\n",
      "[69]: You understand how I feel.\n",
      "[70]: Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.\n",
      "[71]: ...don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.\n",
      "[72]: - Thanks, I will. - Well...\n",
      "[73]: If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?\n",
      "[74]: I guess neither one of our stories is very funny.\n",
      "[75]: - On one condition. - And that is?\n",
      "[76]: Don't be too downhearted.\n",
      "[77]: I'm not interested in politics.\n",
      "[78]: I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself...\n",
      "[79]: My watch stopped.\n",
      "[80]: He certainly didn't come here to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.\n",
      "[81]: ...an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca...\n",
      "[82]: The geography may be a little difficult to arrange.\n",
      "[83]: Might as well be frank, monsieur.\n",
      "[84]: You see, my dear, word has gone around.\n",
      "[85]: But no intention of selling them.\n",
      "[86]: Let's see.\n",
      "[87]: It's the new German 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.\n",
      "[88]: Instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big...\n",
      "[89]: What? Do you know who I am?\n",
      "[90]: Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane.\n",
      "[91]: - Monsieur Rick? - Yes?\n",
      "[92]: I know a little about women, my friend. She went.\n",
      "[93]: - In that case, you'll have to come along. - Wait. It's possible that I...\n",
      "[94]: So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.\n",
      "[95]: ...and wait.\n",
      "[96]: Yes. I put that dress away.\n",
      "[97]: The day you left Paris...\n",
      "[98]: I ran away from you once. I can't do it again.\n",
